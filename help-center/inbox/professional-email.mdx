A professional email address builds credibility with athletes and parents. This guide walks you through setting up `coach@yourbusiness.com` using Google Workspace in about 30 minutes.

<Info>
  **Why does this matter?** Parents and athletes trust businesses with professional emails. A custom domain email like `coach@smithtraining.com` looks more credible than `coach_smith_2019@gmail.com` on your website, invoices, and business cards.

## What you'll need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A credit card for Google Workspace (\$6/month per user)
- About 30 minutes

<Steps>

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Buy through Google (Easiest)">

      - Avoid hyphens and numbers

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your domain">
    <Info>
      **Skip this step** if you bought your domain through Google—verification is automatic.
    </Info>
    Google needs to confirm you own your domain. This sounds technical, but just follow these steps:

    ### Get your verification code

    Google provides a verification code that looks like:

    ```
    google-site-verification=ABC123xyz...
    ```

    ### Add the code to your domain settings

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Namecheap">
        1. Log into Namecheap → **Domain List** → **Manage**
        2. Click **Advanced DNS**
        3. Click **Add New Record**
        4. Configure the record:
           - **Type:** TXT
           - **Host:** @
           - **Value:** Paste the Google verification code
           - **TTL:** Automatic
        5. Click **Save All Changes**
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="GoDaddy">
        1. Log into GoDaddy → **My Products** → **DNS**
        2. Click **Add** under Records
        3. Configure the record:
           - **Type:** TXT
           - **Name:** @
           - **Value:** Paste the Google verification code
           - **TTL:** 1 Hour
        4. Click **Save**
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Google Domains">
        1. Log into [domains.google.com](https://domains.google.com)
        2. Click your domain → **DNS**
        3. Scroll to **Custom records**
        4. Add a TXT record with the verification code
        5. Click **Save**
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    ### Complete verification

    Click **Verify** in Google Workspace. Wait 5-10 minutes if it doesn't work immediately—DNS changes take time to propagate.

    <Warning>
      DNS changes can take up to 1 hour to propagate. If verification fails, wait and try again.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up email routing (MX records)">
    <Info>
      **Skip this step** if you bought your domain through Google—MX records are configured automatically.
    </Info>
    MX records tell the internet where to deliver your emails. You need to point them to Google's mail servers.

    ### Delete existing MX records

    First, remove any existing MX records in your domain settings.

    ### Add Google's MX records

    Add these five records exactly as shown:

    | Priority | Mail Server             |
    | -------- | ----------------------- |
    | 1        | ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM      |
    | 5        | ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM |
    | 5        | ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM |
    | 10       | ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM |
    | 10       | ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM |

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Namecheap">
        1. Go to **Advanced DNS** → **Mail Settings**
        2. Select **Custom MX**
        3. Add each record from the table above
        4. Click **Save All Changes**
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="GoDaddy">
        1. Go to **DNS** → **MX Records**
        2. Delete any existing MX records
        3. Add each record from the table above
        4. Click **Save**
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    <Warning>
      MX record changes can take up to 48 hours, but usually work within 1-2 hours. Test by sending an email from a different account.
