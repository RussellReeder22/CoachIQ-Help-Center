## What you'll accomplish

Granting CoachIQ access to your Meta ads account allows our team to create, manage, and optimize your Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns on your behalf. This one-time setup ensures we can deliver results while you maintain full ownership of your ad account.

## Before you begin

<Note>
  **You'll need:**

  - Admin access to your Facebook Business Manager
  - An active Meta ads account
  - Your CoachIQ account manager's email address (they'll provide this)
  - Approximately 5-10 minutes to complete setup
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Important**: You must have Admin permissions on your Business Manager to grant access. If you don't have these permissions, contact your Business Manager administrator first.
</Warning>

## Granting access to your ad account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Meta Business Settings">
    Navigate to [Meta Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings) and log in with your Facebook account.

    Click on **Ad Accounts** in the left sidebar under the "Accounts" section.

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Bookmark the Business Settings page for quick access when managing permissions or reviewing your account.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your ad account">
    From the list of ad accounts, click on the ad account you want to grant CoachIQ access to.

    If you have multiple ad accounts, select the one you use for your coaching business advertising.

    2. Select **Assign ad account role**
    3. Choose **Admin** from the dropdown menu

    </Info>
    Click **Assign** to send the access request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify access was granted">
    You should see the CoachIQ team member listed under "People with access" in your ad account.

    The status will show as "Pending" until they accept the invitation, then change to "Active."

    <Check>
      **Success!** CoachIQ now has access to manage your Meta advertising campaigns. Your account manager will confirm receipt and begin campaign setup.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding access levels

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can CoachIQ do with Admin access?">
    With Admin access, CoachIQ can:

    - Create and manage ad campaigns
    - Adjust budgets and bidding strategies
    - Access performance reports and analytics
    - Create and edit audiences
    - Manage payment methods (if needed)
    - Add additional team members (with your approval)

    **What CoachIQ cannot do:**

    - Delete your ad account
    - Change account ownership
    - Access your personal Facebook profile
    - Make purchases without approved budget parameters
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I revoke access later?">
    Yes, absolutely. You maintain full ownership and can revoke CoachIQ's access at any time:

    1. Go to [Meta Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings)
    2. Select **Ad Accounts**
    3. Choose your ad account
    4. Find the CoachIQ team member under "People with access"
    5. Click **Remove**

    Your ad campaigns will remain in your account even after removing access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will CoachIQ see my personal information?">
    No. CoachIQ only has access to your business ad account, not your personal Facebook profile or data. They can see:

    - Ad campaign performance data
    - Business page information
    - Ad account billing (if managing budgets)

    They cannot see personal messages, photos, or profile information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have a Business Manager?">
    You'll need to create a Business Manager account first. Meta requires Business Manager for granting ad account access to agencies or partners.

    Follow Meta's guide to [create a Business Manager account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657), then return to this guide to grant access.

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Can't find "Add People" button

**Solution**: You likely don't have Admin permissions on the ad account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your permissions">
    In Business Settings, look at your name next to the ad account. Your role should say "Admin."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request admin access">
    If you're listed as "Advertiser" or "Analyst," contact the account Admin to upgrade your permissions or have them add CoachIQ directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Email address not being accepted

**Issue**: Meta shows an error when entering the CoachIQ team member's email.

**Solutions**:

- Verify the email address with your CoachIQ account manager (check for typos)
- Ensure the email isn't already associated with another Business Manager
- Try using their Business Manager ID instead (CoachIQ can provide this)
- Make sure you're entering the email in the correct field (not the "Add Partner" field)

### "You've reached the limit for people" error

**Issue**: Meta limits the number of people with access to each ad account.

**Solution**: Remove inactive team members or previous agency access:

1. Review people currently with access
2. Remove anyone no longer working with your account
3. Try adding CoachIQ again

If you still can't add them, contact Meta Business Support.

### CoachIQ isn't seeing the access invitation

**Immediate steps**:

1. Wait 15 minutes (invitations can take time to appear)
2. Verify you used the correct email address
3. Check that you selected "Admin" access level
4. Have your CoachIQ account manager check their Business Manager notifications

**If still not resolved**: Screenshot your Business Settings showing CoachIQ listed with "Pending" status and send to your account manager.

## Alternative: Using Business Manager ID

If email-based access isn't working, you can grant access using CoachIQ's Business Manager ID:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the Business Manager ID">
    Request CoachIQ's Business Manager ID from your account manager (it's a string of numbers).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add partner using ID">
    In Business Settings:

    1. Go to **Ad Accounts**
    2. Select your ad account
    3. Click **Add Partner**
    4. Enter the Business Manager ID
    5. Assign **Admin** access
    6. Click **Assign**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

After granting access, your CoachIQ account manager will:

1. **Confirm receipt** (usually within 1 business day)
2. **Audit your current setup** (if you have existing campaigns)
3. **Schedule campaign planning** to discuss your advertising goals
4. **Begin campaign creation** based on your approved strategy
5. **Provide regular reporting** on campaign performance

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Schedule a quick call with your CoachIQ account manager after granting access to discuss your advertising goals, target audience, and budget parameters. This ensures campaigns align with your business objectives from day one.
