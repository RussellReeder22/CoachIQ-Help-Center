<Info>
  **Quick check**: Most missing sessions are caused by the connected coach being booked elsewhere, availability settings, or session limits.

## Common causes & fixes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Connected coach already booked (double-booking prevention)">
    **Very common** - If the coach assigned to this scheduler has sessions booked at the same times through another scheduler, those time slots won't appear. This is CoachIQ preventing double-bookings.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Calendar**
    2. Check if the connected coach has existing sessions during the times you expect to see availability
    3. If they do, that's why those slots aren't showing — the coach is already booked
    4. To free up slots, either cancel/reschedule the conflicting sessions or adjust the coach's availability

    <Tip>
      **Example**: Coach Mike is connected to both "Private Training" and "Group Classes" schedulers. If he has a Group Class booked Monday 4-5pm, that slot won't appear for Private Training bookings either — even though both schedulers pull from the same availability.
    </Tip>

    **To check which coach is connected:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Schedulers**
    2. Select the scheduler in question
    3. Look for **Connected Coaches** section
    4. Note which coach(es) are assigned, then check their calendar for conflicts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Availability not set for that time">
    **Most common issue** - Your availability determines when clients can book.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Availability**
    2. Check if you have availability set for the day/time in question
    3. Add availability blocks that cover when you want sessions bookable
    4. Save changes

    <Tip>
      Sessions can only be booked during times you've marked as available. If you're available Monday 9am-5pm, but only set availability for 9am-12pm, afternoon slots won't show.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Session limit reached">
    Your scheduler may have a maximum number of sessions per day/week.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Schedulers**
    2. Select the scheduler you're troubleshooting
    3. Check "Max bookings per day", "Maximum bookings per week", "Max athletes per time slot"
    4. Increase limits or untoggle the limit to allow unlimited booking
    5. Click **Save**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Minimum notice requirement">
    You may require clients to book a certain time in advance.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Schedulers**
    2. Select the scheduler you're troubleshooting
    3. Check the **Minimum notice** setting (e.g., 24 hours)
    4. Reduce if needed or set to 0 for same-day booking
    5. Click **Save**

    <Note>
      Example: If minimum notice is 24 hours and the session is on Monday at 6 pm, then athletes can't book after Sunday at 6 pm.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="5. Date range restrictions">
    Sessions may have start/end dates limiting bookability.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Schedulers**
    2. Select the scheduler you're troubleshooting
    3. Check **Set Date Range** settings
    4. Verify "Start date" hasn't passed and "End date" hasn't arrived
    5. Adjust dates as needed
    6. Click **Save**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="6. Session already booked">
    Someone may have already booked that specific time slot.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Calendar**
    2. Check if the time slot shows an existing session
    3. If it's an error, cancel the existing session
    4. The slot will become available again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="7. Timezone mismatch">
    Your availability may be set in a different timezone than expected.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Availability **→ **Select Availability **
    2. Check the **Timezone** setting at the top of your availability
    3. Verify it matches your actual timezone
    4. Update if incorrect
    5. Save changes and check calendar again - times will adjust

    <Warning>
      If you recently changed timezones, your availability blocks may have shifted. Review and adjust as needed.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="8. Buffer time between sessions">
    Buffer settings prevent back-to-back bookings.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Schedulers** → Select the scheduler
    2. Find **Buffer** settings
    3. Check "Buffer before" and "Buffer after" values
    4. Reduce if blocking too many slots
    5. Click **Save**

    <Note>
      Example: 30-minute buffer after each 60-minute session means a 10am session blocks booking until 11:30am.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="9. Scheduler is inactive">
    The scheduler might be disabled or turned off.

    **Fix:**

    1. Go to **Schedule** → **Schedulers**
    2. Select the scheduler you're troubleshooting
    3. At the top of the scheduler settings, check if **Active** is toggled on
    4. If it's off, toggle it on to enable bookings
    5. Click **Save**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick diagnostic checklist

Work through this in order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for coach conflicts first">
    - Go to **Schedule** → **Calendar** and look at the connected coach's schedule
    - If they have sessions booked from other schedulers during those times, that's why slots aren't showing
    - This is the most overlooked cause when "everything looks right" but slots still don't appear
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify basic setup">
    - Scheduler is **Active**
    - You have availability set for the desired day/time
    - A coach is connected to the scheduler
    - The time slot isn't already booked
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check booking restrictions">
    - Minimum notice isn't blocking near-term slots
    - Daily/weekly session limits aren't maxed out (check in **Schedule** → **Schedulers**)
    - Date range includes the timeframe you're checking
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review time settings">
    - Timezone is correct
    - Buffer times aren't blocking adjacent slots
    - Session duration matches your availability blocks
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Found the issue?** After making changes, refresh your booking page or check from a client's perspective to verify sessions now appear.
</Check>

## Still not showing up?

If you've checked everything above and sessions still aren't appearing:

1. **Test from client view**: Visit your booking page while logged out or in incognito mode
2. **Check specific session**: Go to **Schedule** → **Scheduler** and verify the session exists
3. **Clear cache**: Browser cache can show outdated availability
4. **Contact support**: Include screenshots of your availability settings and the issue
