## Overview

When enabled, athletes can cancel their own subscriptions directly from their portal without contacting you. This gives them autonomy while reducing your administrative workload.

## Enabling self-service cancellation

Before athletes can cancel, you need to enable this option for the subscription product.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your subscription product">
    From your dashboard, go to **Products** and select the subscription product you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable cancellation option">
    Scroll to the subscription settings and toggle **ON** the "Allow users to cancel" option.

    <Tip>
      **Best practice**: Enable this for most subscriptions to reduce support requests. Only disable if you want to have a conversation before cancellations.
    </Tip>
    Save your changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>
