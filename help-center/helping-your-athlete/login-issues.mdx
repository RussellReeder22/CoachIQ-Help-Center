## Common login issues

Most athlete login problems fall into one of these categories and can be resolved quickly.

## Password problems

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send a password reset">
    The fastest solution is to have your athlete reset their password:

    1. Tell them to tap **"Forgot Password?"** on the login screen
    2. They'll enter their email address
    3. They'll receive a reset link within minutes
    4. Have them check their spam folder if they don't see it

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Athletes often forget which email they used. Check your Athletes list in CoachIQ to confirm their registered email address.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the correct email">
    Athletes sometimes try logging in with the wrong email address:

    - Check which email is associated with their account in your Athletes list
    - Confirm they're using that exact email (not a different personal email)
    - Watch for typos - a single character makes the difference
  </Step>
</Steps>

## App-specific issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="They see 'Invalid credentials' error">
    This means either the email or password is incorrect:

    - Confirm they're using the correct email (check your Athletes list)
    - Have them try the password reset process
    - Make sure they're not including any extra spaces when typing
    - Check if caps lock is on
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verification issues

<Warning>
  If an athlete previously had access but can no longer log in, they may have been removed from your group and organization.
</Warning>

**Check their status:**

1. Navigate to **People** in your dashboard
2. Search for the athlete
3. Verify their account shows in the list
4. If they're not in your list, they'll need to be added back
5. Click **Add User** and then enter the email associated with their account.
6. If their account exists they'll be added back to your group and organization

<Note>
  Note: Users cannot be deleted once created, only removed from your group and can be added back anytime as an admin.
</Note>

## Still not working?

If you've tried these solutions and the athlete still can't log in:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather details">
    Ask the athlete:

    - What exact error message do they see?
    - What device are they using (iPhone, Android)?
    - Is the app up to date?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact support">
    Reach out to CoachIQ support with:

    - The athlete's email address
    - The specific error message
    - Steps already attempted

    Our support team can investigate account-specific issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Prevention tip**: During athlete onboarding, have them log in while you're together to catch any issues immediately.
