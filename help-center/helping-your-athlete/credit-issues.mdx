  **Quick check**: Credits are added immediately after successful checkout. If they're missing, there's usually a simple explanation.

## Where athletes see their credits

Athletes can view their credit balance by tapping their **profile icon** in the app. This shows:

- Credit balance for each product
- Renewal date (for subscriptions)
- Which schedulers each credit type works for

**Share this with athletes:** If they're asking "where are my credits?", direct them to tap their profile photo in the bottom right of the app.

## Common reasons credits don't show

### 1. Wrong product type purchased

Only products configured with **credits added upon purchase** will add credits to athlete accounts.

**To verify:**

1. Go to **Products** in your dashboard
2. Select the product the athlete purchased
3. Confirm the product type includes credits

### 2.d Credits manually adjusted

If you or another coach manually adjusted the athlete's credit balance, it may override their purchased credits.

- **Check the credit history:**
  - Navigate to **People →Clients → [Athlete/Parent Name] → Credits**
- Review the credit activity log for manual adjustments

### 3. Expired credits removed

Credits have expiration dates based on your product settings. Expired credits automatically revoke access to use from athlete accounts no matter if they are one time or subscription products.

<Tip>
  **Best practice**: Set credit expiration periods that give athletes reasonable time to use their sessions (typically 30-90 days).
</Tip>

### 4. Athlete hasn't refreshed their app

Sometimes credits appear on your end but the athlete's app needs a refresh to display the updated balance.

**Ask the athlete to:**

- Close and reopen the CoachIQ app completely
- Log out and log back in if needed
- Delete and redownload the app

## Quick fix checklist

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Athlete says 'I just paid but don't see credits'">
    **Most likely**: App needs refreshing.

    Ask the athlete to:

    1. Close the app completely and reopen it
    2. Check their email for a payment confirmation
    3. If credits still don't appear after 2-3 minutes, contact you with their transaction details
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credits were there, now they're gone">
    **Most likely**: Credits expired or were manually adjusted.

    Check:

    1. Credit expiration date on the original product
    2. Credit activity log for manual changes
    3. If expired, athlete needs to purchase new credits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete purchased but credits show as 0">
    **Most likely**: Wrong product type or manual adjustment.

    Verify:

    1. Product is configured with session credits
    2. No recent manual adjustments set credits to 0
    3. Check transaction history to confirm purchase details
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Manual credit adjustment

If you've verified everything is correct but credits still aren't showing, you can manually add credits:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to athlete profile">
    Go to **People →** **Clients → [Athlete/Parent Name] → Credits**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add credits manually">
    From the Master or specific product credit bank enter the correct amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notify your athlete">
    Send a quick message letting them know their credits have been added.
  </Step>
</Steps>
