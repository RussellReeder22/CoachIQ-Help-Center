## Quick answer

Most video upload issues are caused by file size limits, unsupported formats, or slow internet connections. CoachIQ supports MP4, MOV, and AVI files up to 500MB per video.

## Common upload problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload keeps failing or timing out">
    **Try these solutions:**

    1. **Check your file size** - Videos must be under 500MB
       - If larger, compress your video using a free tool like HandBrake
       - Or split longer videos into smaller segments
    2. **Verify your internet connection**
       - Upload speeds affect how quickly videos process
       - Try closing other applications using bandwidth
       - Consider uploading during off-peak hours
    3. **Use a supported format**
       - Supported: MP4, MOV, AVI
       - Not supported: WMV, FLV, WebM
       - Convert unsupported formats using a free converter

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: MP4 files typically upload fastest and have the best compatibility across devices.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Video uploaded but won't play">
    **This usually means:**

    1. **The video is still processing**
       - Wait 5-10 minutes after upload completes
       - Refresh your browser
       - Check back if the video is very large
    2. **Browser compatibility issue**
       - Clear your browser cache
       - Try a different browser (Chrome or Safari recommended)
       - Update your browser to the latest version
    3. **Video codec not supported**
       - Re-export your video in H.264 codec
       - Use standard frame rates (24, 30, or 60 fps)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upload is taking an extremely long time">
    **Speed up your uploads:**

    - Videos process based on file size and internet speed
    - Expected times:
      - 50MB video: 2-5 minutes
      - 200MB video: 8-15 minutes
      - 500MB video: 20-30 minutes

    <Warning>
      Don't close your browser or navigate away until you see "Upload complete" confirmation.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: 'File type not supported'">
    **Convert your video:**

    1. Your video format isn't compatible
    2. Use a free converter to change to MP4:
       - CloudConvert (online)
       - HandBrake (desktop app)
       - VLC Media Player (desktop app)
    3. Re-upload the converted MP4 file

## Before uploading: Best practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your video file">
    - **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
    - **Size**: Under 500MB
    - **Resolution**: 1080p or lower for faster processing
    - **Frame rate**: 24, 30, or 60 fps
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your file clearly">
    Use descriptive names before uploading (e.g., "squat-form-tutorial.mp4" instead of "video123.mp4"). This makes it easier to organize in your Media Hub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your connection">
    For large files, ensure you have a stable internet connection before starting the upload.
  </Step>
</Steps>
