## Part 1: Business Structure

<Note>
  **Timeline**: Complete within first 30 days of planning
</Note>

### LLC: The Right Choice for Most Coaches

**Why LLC Works for Training Facilities:**

- **Liability protection**: Personal assets shielded from business lawsuits and debts
- **Tax simplicity**: Pass-through taxation (no double taxation)
- **Minimal paperwork**: No board meetings or complex compliance requirements
- **Professional credibility**: Legitimate business entity status
- **Flexibility**: Works for single owners or partners with customizable profit distribution

**Formation Costs:**

- State filing fee: \$50-500
- Registered agent (optional): \$50-300 annually
- Annual reports: \$50-300 (state dependent)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check business name availability">
    Visit your state's Secretary of State website and verify your desired business name is available for registration.

    <Tip>
      Choose a name that's unique, memorable, and reflects your training specialty. Avoid names too similar to existing businesses in your state.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="File LLC formation documents">
    Complete and submit your Articles of Organization through your state's online filing system.

    **Required information typically includes:**

    - Business name and address
    - Registered agent information
    - Management structure (member-managed or manager-managed)
    - Purpose of business
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your EIN from the IRS">
    Apply for your Employer Identification Number (EIN) through the IRS website. This is free, completed online, and you'll receive your EIN immediately.

    <Info>
      Your EIN is essentially a social security number for your business. You'll need it to open business bank accounts, hire employees, and file taxes.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a business bank account">
    Using your EIN and formation documents, open a dedicated business bank account. This separates personal and business finances—critical for liability protection and tax compliance.

    <Check>
      **Success!** Your LLC is now operational and you have proper financial separation between personal and business activities.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks from start to finish

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard Training">
  Brandon formed Pro Standard as an Indiana LLC through the state website for \$100, establishing himself as the sole owner while offering his general manager profit sharing (a percentage of profits without ownership stake). Ongoing maintenance requires only annual state reports with minimal paperwork.
</Accordion>

### When to Consider S-Corporation Status

An S-Corporation is a tax election, not a separate business structure. You form an LLC first, then elect S-Corp tax treatment with the IRS.

**S-Corp Tax Benefits:**

You can pay yourself a "reasonable salary" (subject to employment taxes) and take remaining profits as distributions (not subject to employment taxes).

**Example savings**: On $100K net profit, you could save approximately $6,000 annually in self-employment taxes.

**Trade-Offs to Consider:**

- Payroll processing costs: \$500-2,000 annually
- Quarterly payroll tax filings required
- Annual corporate tax return (more complex than LLC)
- Accountant fees: \$1,000-3,000 annually
- Must pay yourself "reasonable" salary (IRS scrutinizes this)

<Warning>
  **S-Corp Sweet Spot**: Generally makes sense at \$60K+ annual net profit. Below that threshold, administrative costs typically exceed tax savings.
</Warning>

**Implementation Strategy:**

Form your LLC first and operate profitably for 6-12 months. Once you're consistently profitable above \$60K, elect S-Corp status by filing Form 2553 with the IRS. You can make this election retroactive to January 1st if filed within the first 2.5 months of your tax year.

### Business Structures to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Sole Proprietorship: Never for Physical Facilities**

  Operating as a sole proprietor provides zero liability protection. Your personal assets—home, car, savings—are directly exposed to business lawsuits. If a client is injured and sues, they can pursue your personal property. This structure is never appropriate for facilities with physical injury risk.
</Warning>

**General Partnership: Dangerous for Multi-Owner Facilities**

In a general partnership, all partners are equally liable for business debts and lawsuits. If your partner causes an injury through negligence, both of you can be sued and held responsible. Always use a multi-member LLC instead, which provides liability protection for all owners.

<Tip>
  **Remember**: YOU are the owner. You can find and hire managers, but protect your ownership and personal assets through proper business structure.
</Tip>

### State Selection for Formation

**The Simple Rule**: Form your LLC in the state where you physically operate your facility.

- Operating in Indiana? Form an Indiana LLC.
- Operating in Texas? Form a Texas LLC.
- Operating in California? Form a California LLC.

**Foreign LLC Registration (Usually Not Worth It):**

Some people suggest forming in states like Wyoming or Delaware for perceived benefits. However, if you form in Wyoming but operate in Indiana, you must:

- Register as a "foreign LLC" in Indiana
- Pay filing fees in both states
- Maintain compliance in both states
- File annual reports in both states

<Note>
  For single-location training facilities, the double fees and compliance burden rarely justify any potential benefits. Form in your operating state.
</Note>

---

## Part 2: Insurance Protection

<Warning>
  **Critical**: Obtain insurance coverage BEFORE training your first client. Operating without insurance exposes you to catastrophic financial risk.
</Warning>

### General Liability Insurance (Non-Negotiable)

General liability insurance is your primary protection against client injury claims and should be secured before opening your doors.

**What It Covers:**

- Client injuries occurring on your premises
- Property damage you or your staff cause
- Legal defense costs (even if claim is frivolous)
- Medical payments regardless of fault
- Product liability if you sell equipment or supplements

**Minimum Coverage**: $1M per occurrence / $2M aggregate\
**Recommended**: $2M per occurrence / $4M aggregate (minimal premium difference)

**Annual Cost**: $1,500-3,000 for $1M/\$2M coverage

**Common Claims Scenarios:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slip and fall injuries">
    Athlete trips over equipment left on the floor, parent slips on wet surface near entrance, client falls on stairs due to inadequate lighting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Equipment-related incidents">
    Weight machine malfunctions and causes injury, basketball hoop collapses during use, training equipment breaks and injures athlete.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Training-related injuries">
    Client claims your training advice caused their injury, athlete injured during demonstration of improper technique, overexertion leading to medical emergency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's insurance">
  Brandon obtained $1M general liability coverage through a local Indiana agent for approximately $1,800 annually. He secured coverage after opening (taking significant risk—not recommended). Always get insurance before training your first client.
</Accordion>

### Professional Liability Insurance (Highly Recommended)

Professional liability insurance (also called Errors & Omissions) covers claims arising from your professional advice and instruction—a critical gap that general liability doesn't cover.

**What It Covers:**

- Claims that your coaching or instruction caused injury
- Allegations of negligent program design
- Errors in training methodology or technique instruction
- Failure to properly progress athletes
- Claims of inadequate supervision during training

**Why It's Separate**: General liability covers "accidents" (client slips and falls). Professional liability covers "professional negligence" (your coaching advice allegedly caused harm).

**Annual Cost**: $800-1,500  
**Coverage**: $1-2M per claim

**When It's Essential:**

- Teaching technical skills with injury risk (Olympic lifting, plyometrics)
- Training athletes with previous injury history
- Working with high-level competitive athletes
- Providing any nutritional guidance or program design
- Any activity beyond simply providing facility access

<Tip>
  If you're actively coaching (not just renting space), professional liability insurance provides critical protection for the advice and instruction you provide.
</Tip>

### Property Insurance (Landlord Required)

Your landlord's insurance only covers the building structure—not your business property. Property insurance protects your investment in equipment and improvements.

**What It Covers:**

- Your training equipment, computers, and furniture
- Tenant improvements you made to the space
- Business interruption if facility becomes unusable
- Theft and vandalism of your property
- Electronic equipment and data

**Annual Cost**: \$800-2,000\
**Coverage**: Based on replacement value of your property (not depreciated value)

<Note>
  **Important**: Your landlord's insurance will never cover your contents. This is always a separate policy requirement and often a lease condition.
</Note>

**Coverage Calculation:**

Make a detailed inventory of all your property:

- Training equipment (weights, machines, speed equipment)
- Office equipment (computers, phones, tablets)
- Furniture (desks, chairs, reception area)
- Tenant improvements (flooring, mirrors, lighting you added)

Insure for full replacement cost, not what you paid originally.

### Workers Compensation Insurance (Required for Employees)

Workers compensation insurance is legally required in most states once you hire W-2 employees and protects both you and your employees.

**What It Covers:**

- Employee medical expenses from work-related injuries
- Lost wages during recovery period
- Rehabilitation and physical therapy costs
- Legal protection (employees generally cannot sue if receiving workers comp)
- Disability benefits for permanent injuries

**When Required**: Most states mandate coverage with your first W-2 employee (independent contractors typically excluded)

**Annual Cost**: \$2,000-5,000+ depending on your state and total payroll

<Warning>
  **Penalties for Non-Compliance**:

  - Criminal charges in some states
  - Massive fines (often \$10,000+)
  - Personal liability for ALL medical costs
  - Inability to obtain future coverage
  - Potential business closure by state authorities
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's approach">
  Brandon hired his general manager as an independent contractor (1099), allowing flexibility in management approach. Part-time coaches are W-2 employees who receive direct supervision. Workers compensation covers the W-2 employees only, costing approximately \$2,000-3,000 annually.
</Accordion>

### How to Get Insurance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a specialized insurance broker">
    Work with brokers who specialize in sports, recreation, or fitness facilities. They understand your specific risks and coverage needs better than general commercial agents.

    **Where to find specialized brokers:**

    - Referrals from other facility owners in your area
    - Search "sports facility insurance [your state]"
    - Industry associations (USA Weightlifting, NSCA, local coaching organizations)
    - Online directories of sports insurance specialists
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request and compare 3-5 quotes">
    Get quotes from multiple brokers to compare coverage and pricing.

    **What to compare:**

    - Coverage limits (per occurrence and aggregate)
    - Exclusions (what's NOT covered)
    - Annual premium costs
    - Deductibles
    - Payment options (monthly vs. annual)
    - Broker's reputation for claims handling
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask critical questions">
    Before purchasing, get clear answers to these essential questions:

    **Critical questions to ask:**

    - "What specific situations are NOT covered by this policy?"
    - "Does this cover camps or events I host at other locations?"
    - "Are independent contractors covered when working at my facility?"
    - "What's my obligation if an incident occurs?" (reporting timeline)
    - "Can I pay monthly or is annual payment required?"
    - "What's your average claim response time?"
    - "Are there any exclusions specific to my sport or training style?"

    <Tip>
      If a broker can't clearly answer these questions or seems uncertain about coverage details, find a different broker. You need someone who truly understands your business.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purchase coverage before opening">
    Secure all required coverage at least 2 weeks before your first client trains at your facility. This allows time for:

    - Certificate of insurance delivery (needed for lease)
    - Policy review to ensure accuracy
    - Questions or corrections with broker
    - Peace of mind on opening day

    <Check>
      **Success!** You're properly protected and can focus on training clients rather than worrying about catastrophic financial risk.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total First-Year Insurance Budget**: \$5,000-8,000 for comprehensive coverage (general liability, professional liability, property, workers compensation)

### Insurance Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Critical Mistakes That Expose You to Serious Risk:**

  **1. Skipping Coverage Entirely** One lawsuit judgment can easily exceed $500,000. Your annual $2,000 premium is insignificant compared to this catastrophic risk. Many facilities have closed permanently after a single uninsured incident.

  **2. Choosing the Cheapest Policy Without Review** A dramatically lower premium almost always means excluded coverage. A \$1,000 policy that doesn't cover your primary activities is worthless when you need it most.

  **3. Not Reading Policy Exclusions** Your policy might specifically exclude your sport or training style. Review exclusions carefully and ask questions before purchasing.

  **4. Delaying Workers Compensation** Operating with W-2 employees without workers comp is illegal in most states. Penalties are severe—fines, criminal charges, and personal liability for all medical costs.

  **5. Failing to Update Coverage as You Grow** Added new equipment worth \$50,000? Expanded services? Changed training methods? Notify your insurance broker immediately to ensure continued coverage.
</Warning>

## Part 3: Liability Waivers

### What Waivers Do (And Don't Do)

Understanding the realistic protection waivers provide helps you implement them properly and maintain appropriate expectations.

**What Signed Waivers Provide:**

- Legal defense foundation if you're sued (not a guarantee you'll win)
- Documented proof client understood inherent risks
- Evidence client voluntarily chose to participate
- Significant deterrent to frivolous lawsuits
- Demonstration of your risk management diligence

**What Waivers DON'T Provide:**

- Guaranteed immunity from all lawsuits
- Protection against gross negligence or intentional harm
- Replacement for proper insurance coverage
- Consistent protection across all states (enforceability varies)
- Protection if client proves they didn't understand what they signed

<Info>
  **The Bottom Line**: Waivers are essential but work alongside insurance and safety protocols—not instead of them. Think of waivers as one layer in your comprehensive protection strategy.
</Info>

### Essential Waiver Components

A legally defensible waiver must include specific language and disclosures. Here are the critical components:

#### 1. Clear Risk Disclosure

Explicitly list specific risks inherent to your training activities:

- Sprains, strains, and muscle injuries
- Fractures and broken bones
- Concussions and head injuries
- Contact with other participants or equipment
- Overexertion and cardiovascular stress
- Serious injury including permanent disability
- Death (yes, this must be included)

<Tip>
  Be specific to your sport. A baseball facility should mention balls, bats, and pitching injuries. A strength facility should mention weights, barbells, and lifting injuries.
</Tip>

#### 2. Assumption of Risk

Client must acknowledge they understand these risks and voluntarily choose to participate anyway, with full knowledge of the dangers involved.

#### 3. Release of Liability

Client agrees not to sue your facility, staff, or owners for injuries resulting from ordinary negligence (not gross negligence or intentional harm).

#### 4. Indemnification Clause

Client agrees to cover your legal costs and damages if you're sued because of their actions or if they bring a claim that violates the waiver.

#### 5. Medical Representation

Client confirms they are physically capable of participating safely and have consulted their physician if they have any medical concerns.

#### 6. Emergency Treatment Authorization

Permission to seek emergency medical care if the client becomes unable to consent to treatment during participation.

#### 7. Photo/Video Release (Optional)

Permission to use participant images in marketing materials, social media, and promotional content. Make this optional with a separate checkbox.

#### 8. Facility Rules & Code of Conduct

Agreement to follow all facility rules, policies, and staff instructions. Acknowledgment that you can remove them for violations without refund.

### Waivers for Minors (Under 18)

Waivers for minors present unique legal challenges because minors cannot legally waive their own rights in most states.

**The Legal Challenge:**

Minors (under 18) cannot enter into binding contracts or waive their legal rights. Parents or legal guardians must sign on behalf of the minor.

**Critical Language Requirements:**

- "Parent/guardian signing on behalf of minor participant"
- "Parent/guardian releases facility from liability for injuries to minor"
- "Parent/guardian agrees not to sue on behalf of minor"
- "Parent/guardian assumes all risks on minor's behalf"

<Note>
  **One Waiver Format**: You can use a single waiver that works for both adults and minors. Simply ensure the signature line clearly states: "Participant Signature (if 18+) OR Parent/Guardian Signature (if participant under 18)."
</Note>

**State Variability**: Some states limit parental ability to waive minors' rights. This makes attorney review in your specific state absolutely essential.

### Creating Your Waiver

You have two primary approaches to creating a legally sound waiver:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Template + Attorney Review (Recommended)">
    **Process:**

    1. Find a liability waiver template online (\$0-50) or use AI to draft initial version
    2. Customize template for your specific sport and facility
    3. Have local attorney review for state-specific compliance (\$300-800)

    **Total Cost**: \$300-850

    **Advantages:**

    - Most cost-effective approach
    - Quick initial creation
    - Attorney ensures enforceability
    - Can update template yourself for minor changes

    **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

    <Accordion title="AI prompt for waiver creation">
      "Draft a comprehensive liability waiver and release for a [your sport - e.g., baseball training] facility in [your state]. Include: (1) detailed risk disclosure specific to [your sport], (2) assumption of risk language, (3) release of liability and waiver, (4) indemnification clause, (5) medical fitness representation, (6) emergency treatment authorization, (7) provisions for minors with parent/guardian signature, and (8) optional photo/video release. Use clear, enforceable language appropriate for [your state] law."
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Attorney-Drafted from Scratch">
    **Process:**

    1. Consult with sports law attorney
    2. Describe your facility, activities, and specific risks
    3. Attorney drafts custom waiver
    4. Review and revise as needed

    **Total Cost**: \$800-2,000

    **Advantages:**

    - Fully customized to your situation
    - Attorney familiar with every provision
    - Maximum confidence in enforceability
    - Established attorney relationship for future needs

    **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Don't Skip Attorney Review**

  Waiver enforceability varies significantly by state. Some states readily enforce waivers; others have strict limitations. A local attorney ensures your waiver complies with your state's specific requirements and maximizes your legal protection. The \$300-800 investment is insignificant compared to the protection it provides.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's waiver">
  Brandon obtained his initial waiver from an industry mentor (zero cost), but strongly recommends investing in attorney review for anyone without this connection. His waiver covers injury risk disclosure, assumption of risk, release of liability, and photo release—all essential components. Every participant must sign before any training, camps, or events participation.
</Accordion>

### Collecting & Storing Waivers

How you collect and store waivers affects both convenience and legal protection.

#### Digital Collection (Strongly Recommended)

**Advantages:**

- Integrate with your scheduling and payment system
- Clients sign electronically before purchasing anything
- Automatically stored and searchable
- Can't be lost or damaged
- Instant access during emergencies or legal issues
- Timestamped signature records

**Implementation Options:**

- CoachIQ's integrated waiver system
- Dedicated waiver platforms (WaiverSign, Smartwaiver)
- Electronic signature tools (DocuSign, HelloSign)
- Custom website integration

#### Paper Backup System

Even with digital collection, maintain paper backup procedures:

**Organization:**

- File signed copies alphabetically by last name
- Separate adult and minor waivers if helpful
- Use clearly labeled file folders or binders
- Store in secure, locked location

**Retention Period:**

- Keep indefinitely (safest approach)
- Minimum: statute of limitations in your state plus 2 years
- Never destroy waivers from incidents resulting in injury

<Accordion title="Real-world example: CoachIQ integration">
  Brandon uses CoachIQ's integrated waiver system, which prevents clients from purchasing sessions, memberships, or registering for events without completing the digital signature. Waivers are automatically stored in CoachIQ's system, providing instant access when needed. The one-time signing approach covers all future participation—no annual renewal hassle for clients or staff.
</Accordion>

### When Clients Sign Waivers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Signing (Recommended)">
    **Approach**: Client signs comprehensive waiver once upon initial registration, covering all future activities and participation.

    **Advantages:**

    - Better client experience (sign once, participate forever)
    - Less administrative burden
    - Fewer chances for unsigned participation to slip through
    - Works well with automated digital systems

    **When to Use**: Most training facilities, especially with consistent activities
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Annual Renewal">
    **Approach**: Require waiver re-signing annually, typically at membership renewal.

    **Advantages:**

    - Updates contact information annually
    - Refreshes client awareness of risks
    - Opportunity to update medical information
    - Demonstrates ongoing risk communication

    **When to Use**: Optional approach, particularly if you want regular medical updates
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Activity-Specific Waivers">
    **Approach**: Different waivers for significantly different activities (e.g., standard training vs. ropes course).

    **Advantages:**

    - Addresses unique risks of specialized activities
    - More specific risk disclosure
    - May be required for certain activities

    **When to Use**: Only when activities have substantially different risk profiles

    <Note>
      Most facilities don't need multiple waivers. A comprehensive, well-drafted waiver covering all your activities is simpler and equally effective.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Part 4: Client Service Agreements

Beyond liability waivers, you need clear business terms that govern the commercial relationship with clients.

### Payment Terms

**Essential Components:**

**Pricing Structure:**

- Session rates, monthly memberships, or package pricing
- Any setup or registration fees
- Price changes and notification procedures

**Payment Timing:**

- When payment is due (before service strongly recommended)
- Accepted payment methods
- Credit card on file requirements
- Auto-pay enrollment and processing dates

**Late Fees and Penalties:**

- Grace period (if any)
- Late fee amount and when applied
- Actions taken for non-payment (suspension, termination)

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Require payment before providing services. Never train clients with outstanding balances. This prevents uncomfortable collection situations and ensures your time is compensated.
</Tip>

### Cancellation & Refund Policy

Clear cancellation policies prevent disputes and set proper expectations from the start.

**Key Policy Elements:**

**Advance Notice Requirements:**

- How much notice required for cancellation (2 hours, 24 hours, etc.)
- How clients submit cancellations (app, text, phone)
- Consequences for insufficient notice

**Late Cancellation & No-Show Policies:**

- Late cancellation penalties (forfeit session, fee charged)
- No-show forfeitures
- Exceptions for emergencies (define what qualifies)

**Refund Policy:**

- Refundable vs. non-refundable products
- Partial refund conditions (if any)
- Refund processing timeline
- Unused credit expiration dates

**Sample Policy Language:**

"Cancellations require 2+ hours advance notice. Late cancellations (less than 2 hours) forfeit the session credit. No-shows forfeit the session with no credit or refund. Monthly memberships are non-refundable but can be paused up to 2 months per year with 7 days advance notice."

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's policies">
  Brandon's facility uses monthly auto-renewing memberships requiring payment before participation via saved credit cards in CoachIQ. His cancellation policy requires 2 hours notice for credit back. The stated policy is no refunds, but Brandon exercises discretion for genuine hardship situations to maintain goodwill while firmly enforcing the policy for "just because" requests.
</Accordion>

### Commitment Terms

**Membership Duration:**

- Month-to-month vs. 3/6/12-month commitments
- Auto-renewal provisions and client notification
- Termination procedures and required notice
- Early termination fees (if applicable)

**Pause/Freeze Options:**

- How many pauses allowed per year
- Maximum pause duration
- Notice required to pause
- Fees for pausing (if any)

### Behavior Expectations & Code of Conduct

Establish clear behavioral standards to maintain a positive training environment.

**Essential Conduct Policies:**

**Respect Requirements:**

- Respectful treatment of coaches, staff, and other participants
- Appropriate language (no profanity, discrimination, harassment)
- Proper equipment use and care
- Following coach instructions and facility rules

**Parent Conduct Policies (Youth Facilities):**

- Appropriate sideline behavior during training
- No coaching from sidelines
- Respect for coaching staff decisions
- Communication protocols

**Consequences for Violations:**

- Warning system (verbal warning, written warning)
- Temporary suspension
- Permanent removal from facility
- No refunds for behavioral removals

### Making Agreements Enforceable

**Legal Requirements for Enforceable Contracts:**

- **Clear language**: No incomprehensible legalese that clients can't understand
- **Reasonable terms**: Not extremely one-sided or unconscionable
- **Proper signature and date**: Client signs and dates the agreement
- **Client received copy**: Provide signed copy to client immediately
- **Knowing agreement**: Not buried in fine print or hidden

**Best Practices for Enforcement:**

- Email clients their signed agreement copy immediately
- Reference terms in your regular communications
- Enforce consistently (don't make exceptions that create precedent)
- Document all policy violations and consequences
- Update agreements when policies change (with client notice)

<Tip>
  **Consistency is Key**: Once you make exceptions to your policies, those exceptions can become the expected standard. Be thoughtful about when and why you deviate from your stated terms.
</Tip>

## Part 5: Risk Management Systems

Effective risk management goes beyond legal documents—it requires daily operational systems that prevent incidents before they occur.

### Daily Safety Protocols

**Daily Opening Checklist:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Equipment condition inspection">
    - Check all training equipment for wear, damage, or malfunction
    - Verify nets, hoops, and padding are secure
    - Test machines and moving parts
    - Ensure safety equipment (pads, helmets) is functional
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Facility hazard check">
    - Inspect floors for wet spots, tears, or debris
    - Verify all lighting is functional
    - Ensure emergency exits are clear and accessible
    - Check restrooms for safety hazards
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Emergency preparedness">
    - Verify first aid kit is stocked
    - Confirm AED is functional (if present)
    - Ensure emergency contact information is posted
    - Check fire extinguisher is accessible and inspected
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Responsibility**: Assign opening staff member to complete checklist before any clients arrive. Document completion in a log.

<Info>
  **Why Documentation Matters**: If an incident occurs, your documented daily safety checks prove your diligence and can be critical in your legal defense.
</Info>

### Equipment Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly Maintenance:**

- Visual inspection of all equipment
- Tighten loose bolts, screws, and connections
- Clean and sanitize high-touch surfaces
- Check equipment stability and placement

**Monthly Maintenance:**

- Deep clean all equipment
- Detailed inspection of wear points
- Lubricate moving parts as needed
- Test all electronic equipment

**Quarterly Maintenance:**

- Professional servicing of complex equipment
- Replace worn parts before failure
- Update maintenance logs
- Review incident reports for patterns

**Annual Maintenance:**

- Comprehensive safety inspection by qualified professional
- Major equipment servicing or replacement
- Update manufacturer guidelines and protocols
- Review and update maintenance procedures

<Warning>
  **Tag and Remove Broken Equipment Immediately**

  Never allow clients to use equipment "just this once" when you know it's damaged or malfunctioning. Tag it clearly as "OUT OF SERVICE" and physically remove it from the training area. One injury from known-defective equipment dramatically weakens your legal defense.
</Warning>

### Emergency Preparedness

**Required Equipment:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="First Aid Kit" icon="kit-medical">
    Well-stocked, easily accessible location, staff trained in use, regularly inspected and restocked

</CardGroup>

**Written Emergency Action Plan:**

Your facility needs documented procedures for:

- Medical emergencies and injury response
- Fire emergencies and evacuation procedures
- Severe weather and natural disasters
- Security threats and active intruder situations
- Utility failures (power, water, HVAC)

**Staff Training Requirements:**

- **CPR/First Aid certification**: Highly recommended for all staff who supervise training
- **Emergency procedure review**: Quarterly training sessions
- **Practice drills**: Conduct annually minimum (fire, medical emergency, evacuation)
- **New staff onboarding**: Complete emergency training before unsupervised shifts

<Tip>
  Many local fire departments offer free fire safety training and will conduct facility inspections to help you identify hazards.
</Tip>

### Incident Documentation

Document every incident that occurs at your facility, regardless of severity.

**Required Documentation for Every Incident:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic incident information">
    - Date and time of incident
    - Exact location within facility
    - Names of all people involved
    - Witnesses present (names and contact info)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detailed incident description">
    Write exactly what happened in factual terms:

    - What was the person doing?
    - How did the injury occur?
    - What equipment was involved?
    - Environmental conditions at the time

    <Note>
      **Write Facts, Not Opinions**: Document what you observed, not what you think caused it. "Client fell while running" is factual. "Client was running too fast and lost control" is opinion.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Injury and response details">
    - Description of visible injuries
    - First aid provided (by whom and what actions)
    - Whether EMS was called
    - Whether client went to hospital
    - Client's condition when leaving facility
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow-up and notification">
    - Parent notification (if minor) - time and method
    - Insurance notification (if potentially serious)
    - Follow-up needed or scheduled
    - Any equipment taken out of service

    <Check>
      **Success!** You have complete documentation that protects you legally and helps identify safety improvements.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Why Comprehensive Documentation Matters:**

If a lawsuit is filed months or years after an incident, your detailed contemporaneous records prove what actually happened versus what the plaintiff claims. Memory fades; documented facts remain.

**Insurance Notification Requirements:**

<Warning>
  **Critical Timing**: Report any potential claim to your insurance carrier within 24-48 hours. Most policies require notification within 30 days. Late reporting can void your coverage entirely—even if the claim is legitimate.
</Warning>

### Medical Information Collection

Collect essential medical information from every client to ensure safe participation and proper emergency response.

**Required Information:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Emergency contacts">
    Minimum two emergency contacts with:

    - Full name and relationship to client
    - Phone number (mobile preferred)
    - Alternative contact method
    - Whether they have authority to make medical decisions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Medical conditions">
    Any conditions that could affect safe participation:

    - Asthma, diabetes, heart conditions
    - Seizure disorders
    - Previous serious injuries (especially relevant to training)
    - Any condition requiring activity modification
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allergies and medications">
    - Severe allergies (especially anaphylaxis risk)
    - Current medications
    - Location of emergency medication (EpiPen, inhaler)
    - Instructions for medication administration if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Physician information">
    - Primary care physician name
    - Physician phone number
    - Permission to contact physician if needed
    - Recent physical exam date (for competitive athletes)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Storage and Privacy Requirements:**

<Warning>
  **HIPAA Compliance**: Medical information must be kept confidential and secure. Limit staff access to only those who need it for safety purposes. Store paper forms in locked cabinets; digital records in password-protected systems.
</Warning>

**Annual Updates:**

Medical conditions, medications, and emergency contacts change. Request updated information annually, typically at membership renewal or before each season.

### Child Safety Protocols

Facilities serving minors must implement comprehensive child protection measures.

#### Background Checks (Non-Negotiable)

**Minimum Required Screening:**

- Criminal background check
- Sex offender registry check
- Reference verification

**Cost**: \$20-100 per person\
**Timeline**: 3-7 business days typically

**Legal Requirements**: Many states mandate background checks for anyone working with minors. Verify your state's specific requirements.

<Warning>
  **Before They Work With Kids**: Complete background checks before staff members have any unsupervised contact with minors. No exceptions.
</Warning>

#### Visibility & Supervision Protocols

**Critical Safety Measures:**

- **No one-on-one behind closed doors**: All coaching and training occurs in visible areas
- **Windows in offices**: Private rooms need windows or open doors during sessions
- **Multiple staff present**: Schedule overlapping shifts when possible
- **Security cameras throughout**: Both safety tool and deterrent (post signs notifying of cameras)

**Two-Deep Leadership**: When possible, maintain at least two staff members present when working with groups of minors.

#### Check-In/Check-Out Procedures

**Arrival Protocol:**

- Document who dropped off minor (name, relationship, time)
- Verify authorized pickup list is current
- Minor signs in or scans in
- Photo ID on file for authorized adults

**Departure Protocol:**

- Only release to authorized adults listed
- Verify ID for unfamiliar adults
- Document time and who picked up
- Never allow minor to leave alone without written parent authorization

**Digital Tracking**: Use your management software (like CoachIQ) to automatically log arrival and departure times.

#### Communication Policies

**Protect Staff and Athletes:**

- **All coach-athlete communication through parents**: No private messaging with minors
- **Team communication apps only**: Use group platforms, never personal phone numbers
- **No social media direct messaging**: Connect through official team/facility accounts only
- **Document all communications**: Use systems that create automatic records
- **In-person conversations in visible areas**: Never behind closed doors

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's child safety">
  Brandon requires comprehensive background checks for all staff members before they begin working with athletes. The facility has 24/7 security cameras throughout, providing both safety monitoring and liability protection. CoachIQ automatically tracks athlete check-in and check-out, creating a digital record of facility access.
</Accordion>

### Contractor vs. Employee Classification

Properly classifying workers is critical for legal compliance and affects your insurance, tax, and legal obligations.

#### Employee (W-2) Classification

**Indicators Someone is an Employee:**

- You control when, where, and how they work
- You provide training on your methods and procedures
- You set their schedule and direct their daily activities
- They work only for you during working hours
- You provide tools, equipment, and work space

**Your Legal Obligations:**

- Withhold income taxes and FICA
- Pay employer portion of FICA
- Provide workers compensation insurance
- Pay unemployment insurance taxes
- Comply with wage and hour laws

#### Independent Contractor (1099) Classification

**Indicators Someone is a Contractor:**

- They control their own methods and schedule
- They provide their own tools and equipment
- They work for multiple clients simultaneously
- They can make profit or loss on the work
- They operate their own business

**Your Legal Obligations:**

- Issue Form 1099-NEC if you pay \$600+ annually
- No tax withholding required
- No workers compensation required
- No unemployment insurance required

<Warning>
  **Misclassification Consequences**

  Classifying employees as contractors to avoid taxes and insurance creates severe penalties:

  - IRS back taxes plus interest and penalties
  - State back taxes and penalties
  - Workers compensation violations and fines
  - Unemployment insurance liability
  - Employee lawsuits for benefits and protections
  - Potential criminal charges in extreme cases

  **When Uncertain**: Classify as employee (the safer approach).
</Warning>

**IRS and State Scrutiny**: Tax authorities actively investigate worker classification, especially in industries (like fitness) where misclassification is common.

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's staffing">
  Brandon's general manager operates as an independent contractor (1099), allowing flexibility in how he manages the facility and runs his own business operations. Part-time coaches are W-2 employees who receive direct supervision, follow scheduled shifts, and receive training on facility methods. This clear distinction ensures proper classification.
</Accordion>

## Part 6: Common Legal Issues

Understanding common legal challenges helps you prevent problems and respond appropriately when they arise.

### Client Refund Disputes

**Prevention Strategy:**

- State your refund policy clearly in your service agreement
- Communicate the policy verbally before clients purchase
- Require clients to acknowledge the policy (checkbox in registration)
- No surprises after purchase

**Resolution Process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your policy">
    Does the client's situation fall within any refund provisions you've established? Is there a legitimate reason the policy should apply?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate the situation">
    Consider:

    - Client's reason for requesting refund
    - Whether it's a genuine hardship vs. changed mind
    - Client's history with your facility
    - Potential relationship damage vs. policy enforcement
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your decision">
    **Stand firm when**: Client simply changed their mind, wants to try a competitor, didn't read the clearly stated policy, would create negative precedent

    **Consider flexibility when**: Genuine documented hardship (medical, family emergency, job loss), your error in communication, maintaining relationship is valuable

    <Tip>
      Document your decision-making reasoning in case of future dispute or legal action.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communicate clearly">
    Explain your decision with reference to your stated policy. If making an exception, clarify it's discretionary and doesn't change your policy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Real-world example: Pro Standard's approach">
  Brandon enforces his no-refund policy firmly for "I just don't want it anymore" requests, which sets clear expectations and prevents abuse. However, for genuine hardship situations (documented medical issues, family emergencies, job loss), he evaluates discretionary exceptions to maintain goodwill and positive reputation. All decisions are documented.
</Accordion>

### Injury Claims

When a client is injured at your facility, your immediate response is critical for both their wellbeing and your legal protection.

**Immediate Actions (First 24-48 Hours):**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide appropriate care">
    - Assess the injury severity
    - Provide first aid if trained and appropriate
    - Call 911 if serious or uncertain
    - Document exactly what care you provided

    <Warning>
      **Never Admit Fault**: You can be sympathetic ("I'm sorry you're hurt") without accepting liability ("It's my fault"). Admitting fault can void your insurance coverage.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document everything thoroughly">
    Complete your incident report immediately while details are fresh:

    - What happened (facts only)
    - Who was present
    - What care was provided
    - Witness statements
    - Photos if appropriate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notify your insurance carrier">
    Call your insurance company within 24-48 hours for any injury that:

    - Required medical attention
    - Could potentially result in a claim
    - Involved significant pain or visible injury
    - The client expressed frustration or blame

    <Info>
      **Better Safe Than Sorry**: Your insurance company would rather be notified of incidents that don't become claims than not be notified of incidents that do.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Limit your communications">
    Do not discuss:

    - Who was at fault
    - What you think caused it
    - Your insurance coverage
    - Whether you'll pay medical bills

    Direct the client to your insurance company for all claim-related discussions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Your Insurance Company Handles:**

- Legal defense and attorney fees
- Investigation of the incident
- Communication with injured party
- Negotiation of settlements
- Payment of claims up to policy limits

**Your Role in the Claims Process:**

- Provide complete documentation
- Respond promptly to insurer requests
- Do not communicate with plaintiff's attorney (direct them to your insurer)
- Continue normal operations (don't make facility changes that imply previous fault)

### When to Call an Attorney

**Immediate Attorney Consultation Required:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lawsuit Filed" icon="gavel">
    Answer typically due within 20-30 days. Missing deadline results in automatic judgment against you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regulatory Investigation" icon="building-columns">
    OSHA, state agencies, discrimination complaints require immediate legal representation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Serious Injury" icon="user-injured">
    Catastrophic injuries, permanent disability, or death require attorney involvement from the start.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Employee Issues" icon="users">
    Discrimination charges, wrongful termination claims, wage disputes need specialized employment attorneys.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Attorney Consultation Appropriate:**

- Lease review before signing (essential)
- Partnership or shareholder agreements
- Employment contracts for key staff
- Major contract negotiations (\$50K+)
- Complex client disputes threatening litigation

**Probably Don't Need Attorney:**

- Minor refund disputes (\$500 or less)
- Standard waiver creation (review yes, creation no)
- Routine daily operations
- General business questions (ask your CPA)

**How to Find the Right Attorney:**

- Sports law specialists for facility-specific issues
- Local business attorneys for general matters
- Referrals from other facility owners
- State bar association referral services
- Industry association recommendations

<Tip>
  **Establish Relationship Before Crisis**: Meet with a sports law attorney when you're opening, not when you're being sued. Having an established relationship means faster response when problems arise.
</Tip>

## Part 8: Critical Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **These mistakes have closed facilities and bankrupted owners. Learn from their experiences:**

  ### 1. Operating Without Insurance

  **The Mistake**: Thinking "it won't happen to me" and operating without proper insurance coverage to save premium costs.

  **The Reality**: A single serious injury lawsuit can result in judgments of \$500,000+. Without insurance, you're personally liable for this entire amount, which can mean losing your home, savings, and business.

  **The Solution**: Secure minimum $1M/$2M general liability before your first client. This \$1,500-3,000 annual investment protects against catastrophic financial ruin.

  ---

  ### 2. No Signed Waivers

  **The Mistake**: Allowing clients to participate before completing waivers, having waivers available but not requiring signatures, or using verbal agreements instead of written waivers.

  **The Reality**: Without a signed waiver, you have no documented proof that clients understood and assumed the inherent risks. Your legal defense is dramatically weakened, and you may be personally liable even for injuries from risks clients should have expected.

  **The Solution**: Build waiver signing into your registration process—make it impossible to bypass. Digital systems like CoachIQ prevent purchase/registration without waiver completion.

  ---

  ### 3. Generic or Unreviewed Waivers

  **The Mistake**: Downloading a generic waiver template from the internet and using it without attorney review in your state.

  **The Reality**: Waiver enforceability varies dramatically by state. A waiver that's enforceable in California may be worthless in New York. Generic waivers often miss state-specific requirements or include unenforceable provisions.

  **The Solution**: Invest \$300-800 in local attorney review of your waiver. They'll ensure it complies with your state's specific requirements and case law.

  ---

  ### 4. Sole Proprietorship Structure

  **The Mistake**: Operating your facility as a sole proprietor to avoid formation costs and paperwork.

  **The Reality**: As a sole proprietor, there's no legal separation between you and your business. When your business is sued, your personal assets (home, car, savings, retirement accounts) are directly at risk.

  **The Solution**: Form an LLC before opening. The \$100-500 formation cost provides invaluable personal asset protection.

  ---

  ### 5. Misclassifying Employees as Contractors

  **The Mistake**: Treating coaches and staff as independent contractors (1099) when they're actually employees (W-2) to avoid payroll taxes and workers compensation costs.

  **The Reality**: IRS and state agencies actively pursue misclassification cases. Penalties include back taxes plus interest, substantial fines, workers compensation violations, and potential employee lawsuits for benefits and protections.

  **The Solution**: When uncertain about classification, treat workers as employees. The administrative costs of proper classification are far less than misclassification penalties.

  ---

  ### 6. No Incident Documentation

  **The Mistake**: Failing to document injuries and incidents because they seem minor or clients say they're "fine."

  **The Reality**: Lawsuits can be filed months or years after incidents. Without contemporaneous documentation, it's your memory against the plaintiff's version of events. Judges and juries believe documented facts over undocumented memories.

  **The Solution**: Document every incident immediately, no matter how minor. Use a standard incident report form and complete it the same day the incident occurs.

  ---

  ### 7. Signing Lease Without Attorney Review

  **The Mistake**: Signing a commercial lease without having an attorney review it to save \$500-1,000 in legal fees.

  **The Reality**: Commercial leases are complex legal documents heavily favoring landlords. Hidden provisions can cost you tens of thousands: personal guarantees making you liable beyond your business, expensive maintenance obligations, renewal terms that trap you, or early termination penalties.

  **The Solution**: Always have a business attorney review your lease before signing. The $500-1,000 investment frequently saves $50,000+ in problems and provides negotiating leverage.

  ---

  ### 8. Skipping Background Checks

  **The Mistake**: Hiring staff to work with minors without completing criminal background checks to save \$20-100 per person.

  **The Reality**: Many states legally require background checks for anyone working with minors. Beyond legal compliance, hiring someone with a concerning history who harms a child creates catastrophic liability. Your facility could be held liable for negligent hiring.

  **The Solution**: Complete criminal background and sex offender registry checks for all staff before they work with minors. This is non-negotiable.

  ---

  ### 9. Verbal Agreements Without Written Documentation

  **The Mistake**: Making verbal agreements with clients, staff, or partners about important terms, thinking a handshake and trust are sufficient.

  **The Reality**: Verbal promises are essentially worthless in legal disputes. Without written documentation, it becomes one person's word against another's. Memories fade, people remember things differently, and relationships change.

  **The Solution**: Document everything in writing: employment terms, client agreements, partnership arrangements, significant decisions. "Get it in writing" should be your default approach.

  ---

  ### 10. No Emergency Action Plan

  **The Mistake**: Thinking you'll figure out emergency response "if something happens" rather than creating and practicing a written emergency plan.

  **The Reality**: Emergencies require immediate, coordinated response. Without a plan and training, staff freeze, make wrong decisions, or take actions that worsen the situation. This puts lives at risk and dramatically increases liability.

  **The Solution**: Create a written emergency action plan covering medical emergencies, fire, severe weather, and security threats. Train all staff and conduct practice drills at least annually.
</Warning>

## Conclusion

Legal protection isn't paranoia—it's fundamental to smart business operation. A systematic approach to business structure, insurance coverage, liability waivers, and safety protocols allows you to coach confidently, knowing you've protected your business, your clients, and your personal assets.

**Your implementation path:**

1. **Immediate** (Before opening): Form LLC, obtain insurance, create attorney-reviewed waiver
2. **First 30 days**: Integrate systems, train staff, establish protocols
3. **Ongoing**: Document everything, maintain equipment, update as needed
4. **Annual**: Review coverage, update documents, train staff

Follow this framework, adapt it to your state's requirements, and consult qualified professionals when needed. Your facility's long-term success depends on a solid legal foundation as much as coaching excellence.
