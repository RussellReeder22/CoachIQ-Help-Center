  **Legal Disclaimer**

  This guide provides general information and best practices for hiring and managing training staff. It is NOT legal advice and should not be relied upon as such. Employment law, worker classification rules, wage and hour requirements, and contractual enforceability vary significantly by state, jurisdiction, and specific circumstances.

  **Before implementing any practices described in this guide:**

  - Consult with a qualified employment attorney licensed in your state
  - Work with an HR professional or certified public accountant for compensation and classification questions
  - Verify compliance with federal, state, and local labor laws
  - Review insurance and liability requirements with your business insurance provider

  CoachIQ and the authors assume no liability for legal, financial, or other consequences resulting from the use of information in this guide. When in doubt, always seek professional legal counsel.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Who this guide is for**: Facility owners and scaling coaches ready to build a training staff that extends their standard of care to every athlete interaction.
</Info>

## Why this guide exists

Your trainers are your business. Every interaction an athlete has with your facility flows through them.

Most facility owners make the same mistake: hire too early, train too little, wonder why growth stalls. This guide exists because hiring trainers is fundamentally different from other roles. You're not filling a position—you're extending your coaching philosophy to someone who will represent everything you've built.

**After reading this guide, you'll be able to:**

- Build a pipeline of candidates without job boards
- Evaluate trainers through action, not interviews
- Structure compensation that's fair and sustainable
- Onboard trainers to independence in 60-90 days
- Retain great trainers for years
- Promote your best trainer to management

## The hiring philosophy

### Never hire too early

The most expensive mistake isn't hiring wrong—it's hiring too soon.

When you hire before someone proves themselves, the relationship becomes transactional from day one. They show up, do hours, collect pay. No investment in your mission. No skin in the game.

<Tip>
  **The mindset shift**: Instead of "I need to fill this role," think "I need to find someone who has already shown they belong here."
</Tip>

### What you're actually hiring for

Credentials matter far less than character.

**The hierarchy:**

| Priority | Trait                     | Trainable? |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1        | Personality & Culture Fit | No         |
| 2        | Reliability & Character   | Difficult  |
| 3        | Coaching Ability          | Yes        |

<Note>
  **Implication**: Hire for personality and reliability. Train for coaching ability.
</Note>

### Red flags that disqualify immediately

<Warning>
  Watch for these immediate disqualifiers:

  - **They don't fit socially with your team** - Forced conversation won't improve under pressure
  - **They can't demonstrate skills at full speed** - You don't need a former pro, but they need proper form on everything they'll teach
  - **They're focused on their personal brand** - If they're asking about posting their own content or training their own clients, they're planning their exit
  - **They've bounced between multiple facilities** - Three gyms in three years = flight risk
  - **Something feels off** - Trust your gut
</Warning>

## Legal foundations: W-2 vs. 1099

This is one of the most critical legal decisions you'll make. Worker misclassification can result in back taxes, penalties, fines, and lawsuits.

<Warning>
  **Critical Legal Consideration**

  Worker classification is governed by complex federal and state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction. The information below is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Some states (like California, Massachusetts, and New Jersey) have very strict classification tests that may differ substantially from federal standards.

  **You MUST consult with an employment attorney licensed in your state before classifying any worker as an independent contractor.** Misclassification can result in:

  - Back payment of wages and overtime
  - Unpaid payroll taxes plus penalties and interest
  - Workers' compensation claims and penalties
  - Unemployment insurance liability
  - Lawsuits from workers
  - Federal and state agency audits

  The cost of proper classification is always less than the cost of misclassification.
</Warning>

### The control test (federal standard)

The IRS evaluates worker status through three categories:

| Category         | W-2 Employee (Academy Model)                | 1099 Contractor (Rental Model)           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Behavioral**   | You dictate drills, methodology, dress code | They use their own methods, attire       |
| **Financial**    | You set prices, collect payment, pay them   | They set rates, invoice clients directly |
| **Relationship** | Ongoing, integrated into core business      | Project-based, peripheral service        |

<Info>
  **The ABC Test** (used in many states): A worker is presumed to be an employee unless they perform work _outside_ the usual course of your business. This is a stricter standard than the federal test. Coaching basketball at a basketball academy would typically = employee under this test.
</Info>

### Why proper classification matters

A common scenario: A "contractor" coach tears their ACL demonstrating a drill. They file for workers' compensation. Investigation reveals misclassification. The business owner may be liable for all medical costs, back premiums, penalties—potentially tens of thousands of dollars, plus possible criminal charges for failure to carry workers' comp insurance.

### General recommendation

<Check>
  **Most training positions should be W-2 employees.** This typically provides the greatest legal protection for both you and your workers. Reserve 1099 contractor status only for truly independent operators (such as a consultant with their own LLC providing specialized services to multiple facilities).

  However, this is a general principle, not legal advice. Your specific situation may differ. Always consult with an employment attorney before making classification decisions.
</Check>

### Contractual protections

<Note>
  **Legal Notice**: Contract enforceability varies significantly by state. Some states heavily restrict non-compete agreements, and enforceability of non-solicitation clauses depends on factors like scope, duration, and geographic limitations. Have an employment attorney draft or review all employment agreements.
</Note>

Consider including these provisions in your employment agreements:

**Non-Solicitation Clause**: May prohibit trainers from soliciting your clients for a specified period after leaving (enforceability varies by state—consult an attorney on reasonable scope and duration).

**IP Assignment**: Specifies that curriculum, video content, or training programs created during employment are "works made for hire" and remain your property.

**At-Will Employment**: States that either party can terminate at any time (standard in most states, but confirm state-specific requirements with counsel).

---

## Finding trainer candidates

### Why job boards often fall short

Posting on general job boards tends to attract people looking for jobs, not necessarily people aligned with your mission. Training isn't typically high-paying—it's often a calling. Job board candidates may optimize for income. Content followers often optimize for alignment.

### The four pipelines (in order of quality)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. In-House Athletes" icon="medal">
    **Highest Quality, Longest Timeline**

    Athletes who've trained with you 3+ years know your system better than anyone. They carry credibility with younger athletes and already love the environment.

    _Timeline: 2-4 years from identification to hire_
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Social Media & Content" icon="hashtag">
    **High Quality, Medium Timeline**

    People who follow you are pre-qualified. They already believe in what you're doing.

    _Key: You're not posting job listings. You're posting content that attracts the type of person you'd want to hire._
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Referrals" icon="handshake">
    **High Quality, Unpredictable**

    A referral from someone you trust starts with built-in credibility. Tell your network specifically what you're looking for.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Cold Applications" icon="inbox">
    **Lower Quality, Heavy Filtering**

    If you must post publicly: post in coaching-specific communities, not general job boards. Make the application require effort (a video response) to filter low-intent applicants.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The interview process

### Why traditional interviews don't always reveal fit

A formal interview tells you how someone performs in interviews—not necessarily how they'll train athletes day-to-day.

### The "come hang out" method

Consider inviting promising candidates to your facility during a normal session to observe and have an informal conversation.

**Setup**: Choose a session run by a current trainer. You and any decision-makers observe from a distance. Invite the candidate to sit with you and talk naturally.

**What you're evaluating:**

| Area         | Look For                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Conversation | Does it flow naturally? Are they curious?  |
| Energy       | Would athletes gravitate toward them?      |
| Philosophy   | Do they focus on athletes or themselves?   |
| Team Fit     | Would the dynamic work with current staff? |
| Authenticity | Real or performing?                        |

<Tip>
  **Duration**: Let it go as long as it goes. The length itself is data.
</Tip>

### The skill verification

<Warning>
  **Important**: They should be able to demonstrate the skills they'll teach with proper form. A trainer who can't demonstrate may lose credibility with athletes. You'll often know if they can just by observing them around the gym.
</Warning>

### The decision

After the conversation: **Invite to next stage** (move to evaluation period) or **Pass** (thank them, move on).

There's no "maybe." Maybe is usually a no.

---

## The evaluation period

### Why observation periods work

A conversation shows who someone wants to be. Time shows who they actually are.

<Warning>
  **Critical Legal Requirement - Wage and Hour Laws**

  Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and most state laws, ANY person performing work that provides value to your business MUST be paid at least minimum wage for all hours worked. This includes training, shadowing, or evaluation periods.

  **"Unpaid trial periods" are generally ILLEGAL if:**

  - The individual is performing work that benefits your business
  - They are displacing regular employees
  - They are performing productive work (even if learning simultaneously)
  - The business derives immediate advantage from their activities

  **Limited exceptions exist for:**

  - True job shadowing where the observer provides no productive benefit
  - Bona fide volunteer positions at non-profit organizations (with strict limitations)
  - Properly structured unpaid internships that meet ALL DOL criteria (extremely narrow)

  **Recommendation**: Treat all evaluation periods as paid employment from day one. Structure it as a "probationary period" or "training period" with clear performance expectations, but pay at least minimum wage (or your standard training wage) for all hours.

  **Consult an employment attorney** before implementing any observation, trial, or evaluation period to ensure full compliance with federal and state wage and hour laws. Violations can result in back pay, liquidated damages, penalties, and attorney's fees.
</Warning>

### Recommended structure for paid evaluation (60-90 days)

| Phase         | Timeline  | Focus                                                        | Compensation |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Observe**   | Week 1-2  | Shadow trainers, help with small tasks, learn names          | Paid hourly  |
| **Assist**    | Week 3-4  | Light corrections, start finding their voice                 | Paid hourly  |
| **Co-Lead**   | Week 5-8  | Lead portions, then half sessions, receive detailed feedback | Paid hourly  |
| **Solo Eval** | Week 9-12 | Run full sessions with minimal intervention                  | Paid hourly  |

<Note>
  Frame this as a probationary employment period with clear performance milestones. Both you and the employee should understand that employment can be terminated during this period if performance standards aren't met (subject to any applicable state laws regarding probationary periods).
</Note>

### What you're evaluating

| Signal                          | Meaning          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Arrives 15+ min early           | High commitment  |
| Arrives late repeatedly         | 🚩 Red flag      |
| Asks questions between sessions | Growth mindset   |
| Becomes unresponsive for days   | 🚩 Red flag      |
| Implements feedback immediately | Highly coachable |
| Gets defensive at feedback      | 🚩 Red flag      |

### Evaluation criteria

<Check>
  **"Can we trust this person to run a workout alone, with none of us in the gym, and feel confident it will meet our standard?"**

  - If **yes** → continue employment beyond probationary period
  - If **"almost"** → extend probationary period with specific improvement goals
  - If **"probably never"** → end employment (following proper termination procedures)
</Check>

## Compensation structures

<Note>
  **Tax and Legal Considerations**: Compensation structures have tax implications for both you and your employees. Consult with a CPA or payroll specialist to ensure compliance with payroll tax withholding, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation requirements, and benefits administration. Compensation must meet or exceed federal and state minimum wage requirements and comply with overtime regulations.
</Note>

### Trainer pay models

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hourly Per Session">
    **Most Common Structure**

    Typical market rates (verify local market conditions):

    | Level        | Rate Range   |
    | ------------ | ------------ |
    | Entry-Level  | \$15-20/hour |
    | Experienced  | \$20-25/hour |
    | Lead Trainer | \$25-35/hour |

    Non-training hours (gym watch, cleaning): \$12-15/hour (must meet minimum wage)

    <Note>
      Ensure compliance with overtime laws. Non-exempt employees must receive overtime pay (typically 1.5x regular rate) for hours over 40 per week.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Per-Session Flat Rate">
    **Session-Based Pricing**

    Typical market rates:

    | Session Type      | Rate Range |
    | ----------------- | ---------- |
    | Group Class       | \$30-50    |
    | Small Group (2-4) | \$40-60    |
    | Private           | \$40-75    |

    <Warning>
      If using flat rates per session, ensure the effective hourly rate never falls below minimum wage. Calculate total session time (including prep and cleanup) to verify compliance.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Revenue Split">
    **For Trainers Building Books**

    Common arrangements (verify with CPA for proper treatment):

    | Scenario                  | Typical Split     |
    | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
    | Trainer brings clients    | 50-60% to trainer |
    | Facility provides clients | 30-40% to trainer |

    <Warning>
      Revenue splits may affect worker classification. High commission percentages combined with operational independence could suggest contractor status. Consult employment attorney before structuring commission-based compensation.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Monthly Salary">
    **Fixed Compensation**

    Typical ranges:

    | Commitment                 | Range               |
    | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Part-Time (10-15 hrs/week) | \$500-1,000/month   |
    | Full-Time (25-35 hrs/week) | \$2,000-3,500/month |

    <Note>
      Salaried employees may be exempt or non-exempt from overtime. Verify FLSA exemption requirements (salary basis, salary threshold, duties test) with employment counsel or HR professional.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Performance bonuses

<Tip>
  Consider these bonus structures to improve retention:

  - Discretionary bonuses after strong months
  - Retention bonuses (90%+ client retention = quarterly bonus)
  - Commission on package sales (5-10%)
  - Non-cash rewards (gear, shoes, unexpected gifts)

  **Note**: Bonuses must be included in overtime calculations for non-exempt employees. Consult with payroll specialist.
</Tip>

### Manager compensation framework

When promoting to management, consider structuring compensation with multiple components:

**Base Pay**: Flat monthly amount for stability (\$2,000-3,500/month depending on scope and market)

**Revenue Share**: Tiered brackets (example structure—adjust for your business):

| Revenue Bracket | Share % |
| --------------- | ------- |
| $0-$19,999      | 8-10%   |
| $20,000-$29,999 | 10-14%  |
| $30,000-$39,999 | 14-16%  |
| \$40,000+       | 16-18%  |

**Quarterly Bonuses**: Tied to hitting performance metrics ($500-$1,500 based on achievement)

<Note>
  Manager compensation structures may affect exempt vs. non-exempt classification. Consult employment attorney or HR professional to ensure compliance with FLSA exemption requirements, particularly for positions combining management duties with hands-on training.
</Note>

## The onboarding system

### The trainer handbook

Every facility should maintain a comprehensive handbook—your single source of truth for policies and procedures.

<Warning>
  **Legal Consideration**: Employee handbooks should be reviewed by an employment attorney to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state laws and to include required notices. Include clear disclaimers that the handbook does not create a contract of employment and that policies can be changed at any time.
</Warning>

### Background checks and SafeSport compliance

<Warning>
  **Critical for Youth Sports Organizations**

  If you work with minors, background checks and abuse prevention training are typically required and may be mandated by:

  - State law
  - National governing bodies (SafeSport for Olympic sports)
  - Insurance carriers
  - Local regulations

  **Typical requirements include:**

  - Criminal background checks for all staff with athlete contact
  - Sex offender registry checks
  - Abuse prevention training (SafeSport or equivalent)
  - Mandatory reporting training
  - "One-on-One" interaction policies
  - Transportation policies
  - Social media and electronic communication policies

  **Consult with:**

  - An attorney specializing in youth sports or non-profit law
  - Your insurance provider
  - Your sport's national governing body
  - Local youth sports organizations for best practices

  Failure to implement proper safeguarding can result in catastrophic liability exposure, loss of insurance coverage, and irreparable reputational harm.
</Warning>

## Ongoing management & retention

### Feedback rhythm

| Frequency                      | Type                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| After sessions (initial weeks) | Quick 2-3 min debrief     |
| Weekly                         | 10-15 min check-in        |
| Monthly                        | Development conversation  |
| Quarterly or Annually          | Formal performance review |

### How to give feedback

<Steps>
  <Step title="Let them self-assess first">
    Start by asking "How do you think that went?" This builds self-awareness and makes them more receptive to your input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Be specific, not vague">
    Instead of "good energy," say "I loved how you called out Sarah by name when she nailed that form—that's the kind of specific encouragement that builds confidence."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tie feedback to athlete impact">
    Connect actions to outcomes: "When you simplified that cue, three athletes fixed their form immediately. That's the difference clear coaching makes."
  </Step>
  <Step title="One focus area at a time">
    Don't overwhelm with a list. Pick the highest-leverage improvement and focus there until it's consistent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Balance confirmation and correction">
    Highlight what's working before addressing what needs work. People implement feedback better when they feel valued.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Addressing performance issues

<Warning>
  **Legal Requirement**: Document all performance issues, disciplinary actions, and termination decisions. Follow consistent procedures for all employees. Inconsistent application of policies can create discrimination claims. Consult with employment attorney before terminating any employee, especially if they are in a protected class or have raised complaints.
</Warning>

| Instance | Recommended Action                                                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First    | Private conversation, clear expectation, document in writing                                        |
| Second   | Written warning referencing first conversation, specific improvement plan, timeline for improvement |
| Third    | Final written warning with clear consequences, document thoroughly                                  |
| Beyond   | Consult employment attorney, follow termination procedures, document decision rationale             |

<Note>
  Some states require specific progressive discipline procedures. Some situations (gross misconduct, safety violations) may warrant immediate termination. Always consult legal counsel for significant disciplinary actions.
</Note>

## Promoting to management

### When to consider promotion

Consider promoting when:

1. You've become the bottleneck to growth
2. Someone has proven themselves over 12+ months
3. You're willing to let them develop their own management style
4. They've demonstrated both technical and interpersonal excellence

### What changes

| Trainer Role                   | Manager Role                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Responsible for their sessions | Responsible for all sessions |
| Takes direction                | Gives direction              |
| Reports problems               | Solves problems              |
| Works in the business          | Works on the business        |

### Manager responsibilities

**Daily**: Facility operations, schedule execution, immediate issue resolution

**Weekly**: Trainer performance monitoring, schedule optimization, client concern resolution

**Monthly**: Revenue tracking, trainer development, operational improvements

<Note>
  Management roles may qualify for FLSA "executive exemption" from overtime if they meet salary and duties tests. Consult employment attorney or HR professional to ensure proper classification, as misclassification of managers as exempt can result in significant overtime liability.
</Note>

### The transition

| Phase       | Duration  | Focus                                                       |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shadow      | 2-4 weeks | Observe your decisions, discuss rationale                   |
| Supported   | 4-8 weeks | Handle day-to-day operations, you're available for guidance |
| Independent | Ongoing   | They run operations, you focus on strategic growth          |

## Final word

Building a training staff is one of the most important things you'll do as a facility owner. The trainers you hire become the face of your business.

This guide provides a framework and best practices collected from successful facility owners. But remember:

<Warning>
  **Every business is unique.** Laws vary by state and jurisdiction. What works for one facility may not be appropriate or legal for another. This guide is a starting point for your research and planning, not a substitute for professional legal, tax, or HR advice.
</Warning>

**Take your time. Do it right. Get proper advice.**

Invest in professional guidance on:

- Worker classification decisions
- Employment agreement drafting
- Handbook policies
- Wage and hour compliance
- SafeSport and youth protection requirements
- Insurance and liability coverage

The cost of proper professional guidance is always less than the cost of legal problems down the road.

<Check>
  **The goal**: Extend your standard of care to someone who will represent everything you've built—while protecting both your business and your employees through proper legal compliance.
