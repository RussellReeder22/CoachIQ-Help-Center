- **User** on accounts where you're an athlete or client

This is helpful if you coach for multiple organizations or if you're also training as an athlete with another coach.

### Switching between groups

Click on any group in the list to switch to that account. Your currently selected group shows **Selected** in green.

<Note>
The Groups list shows both "Staff Groups" (where you're an Admin) and "Athlete Groups" (where you're a User). This lets you quickly switch between coaching and training modes.
