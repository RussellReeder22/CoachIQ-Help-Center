## Managing announcements (broadcast messages)

### How announcements work

Announcements are one-way broadcast messages perfect for team updates, schedule changes, and important notifications. Athletes can react with emojis but cannot reply with text.

<Frame caption="Athletes can react to announcements with emojis, creating engagement without cluttering your inbox">
  ![Announcement showing emoji reactions from multiple athletes](/images/athletereactionstoannouncements.png)
</Frame>

**Key features:**

- Athletes see sender name and timestamp
- Message remains visible until you delete it
- Emoji reactions show engagement (‚ù§Ô∏è, üòä, üëç, üî•)
- No text replies means no inbox clutter

### Sending announcements from your Inbox

All announcements are created and managed through your main Inbox:

## Direct Messages - Two-way conversations

### How Direct Messages work

Direct Messages enable private, real-time conversations between you and individual athletes. This is where personalized coaching and feedback happens.

### Managing conversations in your Inbox

All athlete messages appear in your main Inbox for centralized management:

<Frame caption="Your Inbox shows all athlete messages with timestamps and conversation history">
  ![Coach Inbox interface showing athlete messages, timestamps, and reply functionality](/images/coachinboxviewandsendmessage.png)
</Frame>

**What you see in your Inbox:**

- Athlete name (e.g., "Leeann Collins")
- Message preview and full conversation thread
- Timestamps for each message
- Quick reply box at the bottom
- Archived conversations section

<Tip>
  Messages from athletes appear instantly in your Inbox. Athletes receive push notifications when you reply, creating real-time conversation flow.
</Tip>

### What athletes can do in Direct Messages

Athletes have robust messaging capabilities:

- **Start conversations**: Click message button to contact you
- **Send text messages**: Type and send instantly
- **Share media**: Upload photos and videos directly
- **View history**: See complete conversation thread
- **Receive notifications**: Get alerts for your replies

<Note>
  Athletes can send training videos or progress photos through Direct Messages, making it perfect for technique feedback and progress tracking.
</Note>

## Understanding message privacy

<Warning>
  **Important**: When you send a message to multiple athletes, each receives it as an individual, private message. Athletes cannot see other recipients or their replies.
</Warning>

### How mass messages work:

1. You select multiple recipients (tags or individuals)
2. System creates individual message threads
3. Each athlete sees only their personal copy
4. Replies come back as separate conversations
5. Complete privacy maintained between athletes

This design ensures:

- **Student privacy**: No athlete sees another's information
- **Personalized feel**: Each message appears individual
- **Clean organization**: Separate threads for each conversation
- **Easy management**: Track individual responses

## Push notifications

<Check>
  **Automatic activation**: Push notifications work instantly with no setup required. Athletes receive alerts for all messages and announcements.
</Check>

### Notification behavior:

- **Instant delivery**: Messages trigger immediate push notifications
- **iOS & Android**: Full support on mobile apps
- **Web notifications**: Available if athlete enables browser notifications
- **Smart alerts**: Different sounds/badges for announcements vs direct messages
- **Offline delivery**: Notifications queue when athletes are offline

## Attachment capabilities

### What you can attach to messages:

<Frame caption="Rich attachment options let you share forms, media, products, and scheduling links">
  ![Attachment options showing Forms, Media, Products, and Schedulers](/images/Sendamessageasacoach.png)
</Frame>

**Available attachments:**

- **Forms**: Registration, waivers, surveys, feedback forms
- **Media**: Training videos, technique photos, documents
- **Products**: Membership packages, training programs, merchandise
- **Schedulers**: Direct booking links for sessions

### What athletes can send you:

- Photos (JPG, PNG) - perfect for form checks
- Videos (MP4, MOV) - ideal for technique review
- Text messages with questions or updates

## Best practices for effective communication

### Announcement strategies:

- **Timing matters**: Send during peak app usage (7-9 AM or 6-8 PM)
- **Keep it scannable**: Use bullet points and short paragraphs
- **Clear subject**: Start with the main point (e.g., "CANCELLED: Tonight's Session")
- **Use reactions strategically**: "React with üëç if you're coming"
- **Include actionable attachments**: Add booking links or forms when relevant

### Direct Message tips:

- **Response time**: Reply within 24 hours to maintain trust
- **Professional tone**: Keep conversations appropriate and documented
- **Encourage media**: Ask for form videos or progress photos
- **Personal touch**: Use athlete names and reference their goals
- **Set boundaries**: Establish response hours in your bio

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see a toggle to turn Channels on/off?">
    Channels is always active by default for all CoachIQ users. There's no toggle needed - it's automatically available to all athletes through their portal and to coaches through the Inbox.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes message each other?">
    No, and this is intentional. Athletes can only message coaches to ensure:

    - Proper supervision and safety
    - Privacy protection between athletes
    - Prevention of bullying or inappropriate contact
    - Maintained professional boundaries
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if an athlete has seen my message?">
    While there are no read receipts, you can gauge engagement through:

    - Emoji reactions on announcements
    - Reply messages in direct conversations
    - Athletes mentioning they saw your message
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between In-App and SMS in the message composer?">
    - **In-App**: Sends only to the athlete's portal (free, unlimited)
    - **SMS**: Sends text message to athlete's phone (uses SMS credits)
    - **Both**: You can select both for important messages
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I schedule messages to send later?">
    Currently, messages send immediately. For scheduled communications, consider using Automations to trigger messages based on events or dates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long are messages stored?">
    All messages are permanently stored in both your Inbox and the athlete's Channels for complete communication history and accountability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if an athlete sends inappropriate messages?">
    You cannot disable messaging for individual athletes, but you can:

    - Document the messages (they're saved automatically)
    - Address directly with the athlete and/or parent
    - Remove the athlete from your program if necessary
    - Report serious issues to appropriate authorities
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Create message templates**: Save common announcements as drafts in your notes, then copy/paste and customize as needed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use emoji reactions for quick polls**: "React with üèÄ for basketball, ‚öΩ for soccer" to gauge interest without creating forms.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Media feedback workflow**: Ask athletes to send technique videos via Direct Message on Mondays, then provide feedback by Wednesday.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Tag strategy**: Create tags like "Competition Team" or "Beginners" to send targeted announcements efficiently.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Messages not delivering:

1. Verify athlete has app installed (for push notifications)
2. Ensure you have their correct contact information
3. Test with a different message type (In-App vs SMS)

### Inbox is cluttered:

1. Archive old conversations regularly
2. Use tags to filter active athletes
3. Set up automations for common responses
4. Use announcements instead of individual messages when appropriate
