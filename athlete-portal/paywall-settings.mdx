## What is a page paywall in CoachIQ?

A page paywall is a monetization feature that restricts athlete access to entire sections of your athlete portal until they purchase a qualifying product. When athletes attempt to access a paywalled page without the required product, they see a purchase prompt instead of the content.

![Athleteportal Paywall Page Settings Pn](/images/athleteportal-paywall-page-settings.png)

**Key capabilities:**

- Paywall three core pages: Programs, Scheduling, and Products
- Multiple products can unlock the same page
- Works with subscriptions, one-time purchases, and access codes
- Automatically relocks pages if subscriptions expire or payments fail

## Prerequisites for setting up paywalls

<Note>
  **Required before starting:**

  - At least one product created in Payments → Products
  - Admin or owner permissions in CoachIQ
  - Active athlete portal (configured in App Builder)
  - Pages activated in Menu & Links settings
</Note>

## Setting up your first page paywall

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to paywall settings">
    From your App Builder, click **Settings** in the left sidebar, then select **Pages Paywall**.

    <Tip>
      You can also access this by going to App Builder → Settings → Menu & Links, then selecting Pages Paywall from the sidebar.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select pages to paywall">
    Choose which pages you want to restrict access to. You can paywall:

    - **Programs** - Training content, certifications, and courses
    - **Products** - Your product catalog and purchase options
    - **Schedulers** - Session booking and calendar access

    ![Selectwhichpagesyouwishtopaywall Pn](/images/selectwhichpagesyouwishtopaywall.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add qualifying products">
    Click **\+ Add Product** under the page section you want to paywall. This opens a product selection modal.

    Select one or more products that will grant access to this page. Athletes must purchase at least one of these products to unlock the page.

    ![Selectproducttopaywallspecificpage Pn](/images/selectproducttopaywallspecificpage.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure product grouping">
    You can create multiple product groups (sections) for different membership tiers:

    For example:

    - **Memberships section**: Monthly subscriptions
    - **Virtual Training section**: One-time course purchases

    <Note>
      Products in the same section represent alternatives (athlete needs ANY one). Products in different sections can represent bundles or tiers.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update and activate">
    Once configured, ensure:

    1. The page is set to **Active** in Menu & Links settings
    2. Click **Update Paywall** to save your changes
    3. The paywall takes effect immediately for all athletes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What athletes see when accessing paywalled pages

When an athlete without the required product tries to access a paywalled page, they see:

![Paywalled Athlete App Pn](/images/paywalled-athlete-app.png)

**The paywall experience includes:**

- Clear indication the page is restricted
- Product name and price display
- Description of what's included
- "Purchase Now" or "Learn More" buttons
- Professional branded appearance matching your portal

## Managing multiple products on paywalls

### Adding products to existing paywalls

You can add multiple products that grant access to the same page:

1. Navigate to Pages Paywall settings
2. Find your paywalled page section
3. Click **\+ Add Product**
4. Select additional products from your product list
5. Click **Add Selected**

**How multiple products work:**

- **ANY** product in the list grants full access
- Athletes only need to purchase ONE qualifying product
- Great for offering different price points or payment options
- Perfect for seasonal promotions or grandfathered pricing

### Creating membership tiers

Structure your paywalls for different access levels:
Basic Membership ($50/month)
→ Unlocks: Programs only
Pro Membership ($100/month)
→ Unlocks: Programs + Scheduling
Elite Membership (\$250/month)
→ Unlocks: Programs + Scheduling + Products

### Using sections for organization

Create logical groupings of products:

- **Add Section** to create categories like "Memberships" or "Virtual Training"
- Helps athletes understand their options
- Makes managing multiple products easier
- Each section can have its own description

## Customizing paywall pages

### SEO and URL settings

Configure how your paywalled pages appear in search results and browsers:

- **Page Title**: Optimize for search engines (e.g., "Premium Basketball Training Programs")
- **Meta Description**: Describe the value behind the paywall
- **URL Slug**: Customize the page URL (e.g., `/paywall` or `/premium-access`)

![Clean Shot2025 09 26at20 20 26 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-09-26at20.20.26.png)

<Tip>
  Use compelling descriptions that highlight the value athletes get after purchasing, not just that the content is locked.
</Tip>

### Paywall messaging

The paywall automatically displays:

- Subscription description from your product settings
- Price and billing frequency
- Clear call-to-action buttons

Ensure your product descriptions clearly communicate:

- What's included with purchase
- Billing terms (monthly, one-time, etc.)
- Value proposition for athletes

## Troubleshooting paywall access issues

### Why athletes can't access paywalled pages

**Diagnosis checklist:**

1. **No qualifying product purchased**
   - Check: People → [Athlete Name] → Products tab
   - Solution: Direct athlete to purchase page on web portal
2. **Subscription expired**
   - Check: Payments → Subscriptions → Filter by athlete
   - Solution: Update payment method or reactivate subscription
3. **Payment failed**
   - Check: Payments → Transactions → Failed payments
   - Solution: Have athlete update billing information
4. **Product removed from paywall**
   - Check: Pages Paywall settings for product list
   - Solution: Re-add product or communicate changes to athletes
5. **Page not active**
   - Check: Menu & Links settings for page toggle
   - Solution: Activate the page in settings

<Warning>
  **iOS App Limitation**: Due to Apple's Reader App policy, athletes cannot purchase products directly through the iOS app. They must use the web portal to purchase access to paywalled content.
</Warning>

### Quick fixes for common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Athlete purchased but still can't access">
    1. Verify purchase in People → [Athlete] → Transactions
    2. Check if subscription is active (not past due)
    3. Have athlete log out and back in
    4. Ensure the correct product is linked to the paywall
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subscription renewed but page still locked">
    Failed payments can cause temporary locks. Check:

    - Payment status in Stripe
    - Transaction status in CoachIQ
    - May take up to 5 minutes to sync after successful payment
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access code not working">
    Ensure the access code product is:

    - Added to the paywall product list
    - Not expired or at usage limit
    - Properly redeemed by the athlete
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Want to temporarily remove paywall">
    To temporarily grant free access:

    1. Remove all products from the paywall section

    4. Re-add products when ready to restore paywall
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices for page paywalls

<Tip>
  **Maximize conversion with these strategies:**

  1. **Clear value proposition** - Make it obvious what athletes get behind the paywall
  2. **Multiple price points** - Offer various products to match different budgets
  3. **Trial periods** - Use trial subscriptions to let athletes experience value first
  4. **Bundle strategically** - Create product combinations that make sense for athlete goals
  5. **Communicate changes** - Always notify athletes before adding new paywalls
</Tip>

## Common questions about paywalls

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I paywall individual programs instead of the whole Programs page?">
    No, paywalls work at the page level only. To restrict individual programs, use the program sharing settings in Content → Programs → [Program] → Share Settings instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when a subscription payment fails?">
    The page automatically relocks when a subscription payment fails. Athletes see the purchase prompt again until payment is successful. There's typically a grace period of 3-7 days for payment retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes preview paywalled content?">
    No, paywalled pages are completely restricted. Consider creating a separate "preview" or "demo" section outside the paywall to showcase value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I offer a free trial before the paywall?">
    Create a subscription product with a trial period in Payments → Products. Set the trial length (e.g., 7 days free), then add this product to your paywall.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do paywalls work on both mobile app and web?">
    Yes, paywalls function on both platforms. However, purchases can only be made through the web portal due to iOS restrictions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I have different paywalls for different user groups?">
    Currently, paywalls apply to all athletes universally. For group-specific access, consider using private program assignments or access codes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I want to grant manual access without payment?">
    You can:

    1. Create a \$0 access code product
    2. Add it to the paywall
    3. Manually provide the code to specific athletes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do refunds affect paywall access?">
    Refunding a product purchase immediately removes paywall access. The athlete will need to repurchase to regain access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring paywall performance

Track your paywall effectiveness:

**Key metrics to monitor:**

- **Conversion rate**: People viewing vs purchasing
- **Revenue per page**: Which paywalled pages generate most revenue
- **Churn indicators**: Subscription cancellations after paywall access
- **Support tickets**: Common access issues to address

**Where to find data:**

- Payments → Transactions (purchase tracking)
- Payments → Subscriptions (active membership monitoring)
- People → Activity logs (access patterns)
