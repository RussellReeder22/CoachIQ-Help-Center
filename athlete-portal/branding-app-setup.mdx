## Overview

Your personalized iOS app puts your coaching brand directly on your athletes' home screens. With your own custom app, clients can book sessions, access programs, and engage with your content—all under your business name and logo.

<Info>
**Timeline**: The complete app production process takes up to 30 days from start to finish. You'll have the opportunity to review a test version on your device before the public launch.
</Info>

<Note>
**Don't have a personalized app yet?** The branded iOS app is available as a CoachIQ PowerUp. [Learn more about the Branded App PowerUp](/power-ups/personalized-app) to see pricing, features, and how to add it to your account.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I get a personalized app for my coaching business?">
The branded iOS app is available as a CoachIQ PowerUp. Visit the [Branded App PowerUp page](/power-ups/personalized-app) to see features, pricing, and add it to your account. Once enabled, return to this guide to complete the setup process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I need an Organization account instead of Individual?">
Organization accounts allow you to transfer app ownership, add team members, and present your business professionally in the App Store. Individual accounts are tied to a single person and have limitations for business use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a D-U-N-S number and how do I get one?">
A D-U-N-S number is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses issued by Dun & Bradstreet. Apple requires this for Organization enrollments. You can [request a free D-U-N-S number](https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/) through Apple's lookup tool if you don't have one.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check if my invitation to CoachIQ is pending?">
Go to **Users and Access** in your Apple Developer account. If the status shows "Pending" next to dev@coachiq.io, the invite hasn't been accepted yet. Allow 1-2 business days for our team to accept.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I update my app branding after launch?">
Yes! Contact CoachIQ support to request branding updates. Minor changes (colors, text) can be pushed quickly. Major changes (app name, icon) require a new App Store review.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my Apple Developer membership expires?">
Your app will be removed from the App Store until you renew. Enable auto-renewal in your Apple Developer account to prevent interruptions.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Apple rejected my Organization enrollment">
Common reasons include: mismatched business name with D-U-N-S records, incomplete business registration, or missing verification documents. Contact [Apple Developer Support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/) for specific guidance on your rejection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't find the Users and Access section">
Ensure you're signed in at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) (not App Store Connect) and that your enrollment is fully approved. The Users and Access option only appears after your membership is active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The invitation email to CoachIQ bounced">
Double-check you entered **dev@coachiq.io** exactly. If the issue persists, contact CoachIQ support and we'll provide an alternative email address.
