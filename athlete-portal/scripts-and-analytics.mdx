</Note>

## What you'll accomplish

Add tracking and analytics to your athlete portal's web edition. This lets you:

- Track athlete engagement with Google Analytics
- Run Facebook Pixel for retargeting and conversion tracking
- Load third-party tools (Hotjar, Intercom, etc.)
- Add custom JavaScript for advanced integrations

## Accessing Scripts & Analytics settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to App Builder">
    From your dashboard, select **App** in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Click **Settings** in the navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Scripts & Analytics">
    Choose **Scripts & Analytics** to access your tracking options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Google Analytics

Track athlete behavior, page views, and engagement metrics with Google Analytics.

### Get your Measurement ID

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Google Analytics">
    Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com) and sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Admin settings">
    Click the **Admin** gear icon in the bottom left corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Data Streams">
    Under **Property Settings**, click **Data Streams**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get or create a Web stream">
    Select your existing web stream, or click **Add stream** → **Web** to create one.

    Enter your athlete portal URL (e.g., `app.coachiq.io/your-org/your-portal`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Measurement ID">
    Copy the **Measurement ID** - it starts with `G-` followed by letters and numbers (e.g., `G-ABC123XYZ`).

    <Tip>
      You only need the Measurement ID, not the full script code. CoachIQ handles the script injection automatically.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add to CoachIQ

<Steps>
  <Step title="Paste your Measurement ID">
    In the **Analytics** section, paste your Measurement ID into the **Google Analytics** field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click **Update Analytics** in the top right corner.

    <Check>
      Your Google Analytics tracking is now active on your athlete portal web edition.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verify it's working

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Google Analytics Realtime">
    In Google Analytics, go to **Reports** → **Realtime**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit your athlete portal">
    In another browser tab, visit your athlete portal web edition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for activity">
    You should appear as an active user in the Realtime report within a few seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Facebook Pixel

Track conversions and build retargeting audiences with Facebook Pixel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Pixel ID">
    In Meta Business Suite, go to **Events Manager** → **Data Sources** → your Pixel.

    Copy the **Pixel ID** (a string of numbers, e.g., `1234567890123456`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to CoachIQ">
    In the **Analytics** section, paste your Pixel ID into the **Facebook Pixel** field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click **Update Analytics** to activate tracking.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding External Scripts

Load third-party JavaScript libraries by URL. Use this for tools like Hotjar, Intercom, Drift, or any service that provides a script URL.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the script URL">
    From your third-party tool, copy the script source URL (starts with `https://`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the URL">
    In the **External Scripts** section, paste the URL into the **Script Source URL** field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add more scripts (optional)">
    Click **+ Add Script Source** to add additional script URLs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click **Update Analytics** to load the scripts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Only add scripts you trust.** External scripts have full access to your athlete portal page. Only use scripts from reputable services.
</Warning>

## Adding Custom JavaScript

Run your own JavaScript code for advanced integrations, custom tracking events, or specialized functionality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write your code">
    In the **Custom Js** section, enter your JavaScript code.

    <Tip>
      Don't include `<script>` tags - just write the JavaScript code directly.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click **Update Analytics** to activate your custom code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Custom event tracking

```javascript
// Track when athletes click specific buttons
document.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.matches('.book-session-btn')) {
    gtag('event', 'book_session_click', {
      'event_category': 'engagement'
    });
  }
});
```

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does this work on the mobile apps?">
    No. Scripts and analytics only work on the **web edition** of your athlete portal (accessed through a browser). Native iOS and Android apps cannot execute custom scripts due to platform security restrictions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add multiple analytics tools?">
    Yes. You can use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, multiple external scripts, and custom JavaScript all at the same time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why isn't my tracking showing data?">
    Common causes:

    - **Didn't click Update Analytics** - Make sure you saved your changes
    - **Ad blocker active** - Disable ad blockers when testing
    - **Wrong ID format** - Google Analytics IDs start with `G-`, Pixel IDs are numeric only
    - **Caching** - Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to add the full Google Analytics script?">
    No. Just paste your Measurement ID (e.g., `G-ABC123XYZ`) into the Google Analytics field. CoachIQ automatically loads and configures the tracking script for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between External Scripts and Custom JS?">
    - **External Scripts**: Loads JavaScript files from a URL (for third-party tools)
    - **Custom JS**: Runs your own JavaScript code directly (for custom functionality)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this affect my website tracking?">
    No. These settings only apply to your **Athlete Portal** (App Builder). Website tracking is configured separately in Website Builder → Analytics & Tracking.
  </Accordion>
