## Platform restrictions you must know

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="⚠️ Mobile Apps">
    **iOS & Android Apps - Products NOT Available**

    Due to App Store policies:

    - Products page is completely hidden
    - No in-app purchases allowed
    - Athletes cannot see or buy products
    - This is NOT a bug - it's a platform requirement

    **Alternative**: Direct athletes to your web portal & website for purchases
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Web Portal">
    **Web Browser - Full Access**

    Products fully available when athletes access via:

    - Desktop computers
    - Mobile web browsers (Safari, Chrome)
    - Tablet browsers
    - Any web-based access

    **All features work**: Purchase buttons, payment processing, subscriptions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding the Products page

The Products page displays your payment options, memberships, and packages that athletes can purchase to access your services. It functions identically to the Programs page in terms of organization, but focuses on payment products rather than content.

### Overview

- **Purpose**: Payment collection vs. content delivery
- **Access**: Purchase required vs. content access rules
- **Platform availability**: Web-only vs. all platforms
- **Primary action**: Buy button vs. view content

## Before you begin

<Note>
  **Required**:

  - At least one product must exist in Payments → Products
  - Stripe account must be connected for payment processing
</Note>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't my athletes see products on the mobile app?">
    **This is not a bug.** Apple App Store and Google Play Store policies prohibit in-app purchases that bypass their payment systems. CoachIQ must hide the Products page on mobile apps to comply with these requirements.

    **Solution**: Direct athletes to purchase through:

    - Web browser on their phone
    - Desktop computer
    - Tablet browser
    - Any web-based access
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I sell to athletes who only use the app?">
    Best practices:

    1. **Send purchase links** via SMS or email
    2. **Add announcements** in the app directing to web portal
    3. **Include instructions** in your welcome message
    4. **Process payments** in person or over the phone
    5. **Share QR codes** that link to your web products page
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I accept payments through the app at all?">
    No direct payment processing is possible within iOS/Android apps. However, you can:

    - Use credits (pre-purchased on web)
    - Book sessions that require payment later
    - Send payment links through in-app messaging
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this restriction ever change?">
    This is an App Store/Play Store policy, not a CoachIQ limitation. Unless Apple and Google change their policies, this restriction will remain in place.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I explain this to frustrated athletes?">
    Sample message:
    "To keep our app free and avoid Apple/Google's 30% fees, purchases must be made through our web portal. Visit [your-portal-url] on any browser to buy memberships and packages. This helps us keep prices lower for you!"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do credits purchased on web work in the app?">
    Yes! Once athletes purchase credits through the web portal, they can use them to book sessions within the mobile app. The restriction only applies to the purchase process, not credit usage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Products not appearing in selection

- Verify products exist in Payments → Products
- Check products are active and published
- Confirm Stripe is properly connected
- Refresh the App Builder page

### Athletes report they can't find products

1. **First question**: Are they using the mobile app?
   - If yes → Direct them to web browser
   - If no → Continue troubleshooting
2. Check Products page Active toggle is ON
3. Verify their account has access
4. Test the web portal link yourself

### Purchase buttons not working (web)

- Verify Stripe integration is active
- Check product configuration in Payments
- Ensure product has valid pricing
- Test in incognito/private browser

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Mobile purchase funnel**:
  Create a dedicated "How to Purchase" program in your app that includes:

  1. Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
  2. Direct link to web portal
  3. Video walkthrough
  4. FAQ about why app purchases aren't available
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Pricing page on website**:
  Since products aren't visible in apps, make your website pricing page comprehensive:

  - Detailed product descriptions
  - Comparison tables
  - Clear CTAs to purchase
  - Mobile-optimized design
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Communication strategy**:

  - Add web portal link to email signature
  - Include in SMS appointment reminders
  - Share during trial session sign-ups
  - Post QR codes at your facility
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Section naming for web**:
  Since only web users see this, optimize for conversion:

  - "🔥 Most Popular"
  - "Best Value - Save 20%"
  - "New Member Special"
  - "Limited Time Offer"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track your funnel**:
  Monitor where athletes drop off:

  1. App users who don't know about web purchasing
  2. Web visitors who don't complete purchase
  3. Create targeted messages for each group
</Tip>

## Critical reminders

<Warning>
  **Never promise** in-app purchases are "coming soon" - this is a permanent platform restriction, not a temporary limitation.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Best practice**: Add a permanent message to your app onboarding flow explaining that purchases happen on the web for the best prices and to avoid app store fees.
