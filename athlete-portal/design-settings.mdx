## Design best practices

<Tip>
**Color contrast**: Ensure your primary color and button text color have sufficient contrast for readability. Test with both themes if you allow athletes to switch.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Brand consistency**: Use the exact hex codes from your brand guidelines to maintain professional consistency across all touchpoints.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Theme selection**: Consider your primary user base - dark mode works well for early morning/evening training apps, while light mode is ideal for daytime facilities.
