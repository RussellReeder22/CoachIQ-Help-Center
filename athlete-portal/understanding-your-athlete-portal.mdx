## Give your athletes a professional training experience

Your Athlete Portal is the professional, branded platform where athletes and parents access everything about their training - from booking sessions to viewing programs. You control every aspect of the experience while athletes enjoy a seamless, app-like interface that makes your business look as professional as the big academies.

## What is the Athlete Portal?

The Athlete Portal is your custom-branded platform that gives athletes and parents organized access to their training experience. It's not just a basic login area - it's a complete ecosystem with three access points:

![Rawathleteportalathlete Pn](/images/rawathleteportalathlete.png)

- **iOS mobile app** (your branded app in the Apple App Store)
- **Android mobile app** (your branded app in Google Play Store)
- **Web portal** (accessible from any browser on phone or computer)

Think of it as the athlete-facing side of your coaching business - the polished, professional interface that athletes interact with daily while you manage everything behind the scenes.

## The two experiences: What you control vs what athletes see

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Coach's View">
    You work in the **App Builder** - your control center where you:

    - Design the layout and branding
    - Add or remove features
    - Set up paywalls and access levels
    - Organize content and scheduling
    - Control what athletes can see and do
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Athlete's View">
    Athletes see a **polished app experience** where they:

    - Book and manage their training sessions
    - Access programs and educational content
    - Receive announcements and messages
    - Purchase memberships or products
    - Track their progress and credits
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How athletes get started (Critical for iOS users)

<Warning>
  **iOS App Store Requirement**: Due to Apple's "Reader App" policy, athletes cannot sign up or make purchases directly in your iOS app. They must create their account through your website first or you must add them manually.
</Warning>

### Two ways athletes can join your portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Option 1: Coach adds them">
    The smoothest experience for everyone:

    1. You add the athlete in **People** → **New User**
    2. They receive a welcome email with login credentials
    3. They can immediately download your app and sign in
    4. Full access granted based on their tags/purchases

    **Best for**: Existing clients, trial sessions, team onboarding
  </Step>
  <Step title="Option 2: Athletes self-register">
    Athletes create their own accounts:

    1. Athlete visits your CoachIQ website
    2. Creates account through web portal
    3. Makes any initial purchases (memberships/credits)
    4. Downloads your app and logs in with web credentials

    **Best for**: New sign-ups, online programs, self-service model
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Platform differences

## What athletes CANNOT do

## Your control center: The App Builder

### Core structure

- **Products**: Memberships and purchases

### Settings controls

- **Pages Paywall**: Access restrictions and monetization

![Athleteportalcoachesside Pn](/images/athleteportalcoachesside.png)

### How changes work

- Changes update in real-time as you build
- Use "Update Page" to save your work
- Athletes see changes immediately after publishing
- Preview mode lets you test the athlete experience

## Key concepts to understand

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sections">
    The building blocks of each page. You organize content into sections like "Elite Program" or "Beginner Training" to create logical groupings for athletes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pages">
    The four main areas of your portal: Channels (communication), Content (programs), Schedule (bookings), and Products (purchases). Each can be toggled on/off.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Paywall">
    Your monetization boundary. Set which pages or content require payment to access. Non-members see a preview with payment options.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reader App">
    Apple's classification for apps that display content purchased elsewhere. This is why iOS users must sign up and pay through your website, not the app.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't athletes sign up in the iOS app?">
    Apple requires "reader apps" like CoachIQ to handle sign-ups and payments outside the app. This protects you from Apple's 30% commission but means iOS users must start on your website.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the best way to onboard new athletes?">
    For smoothest onboarding:

    1. Add them manually in the People section
    2. Have them create accounts on your website first
    3. Then direct them to download the app
    4. Include clear instructions in welcome emails
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can parents and athletes share an account?">
    It's best practice to have separate accounts for tracking and communication, but parents can create accounts to manage younger athletes' bookings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where do iOS users make purchases?">
    All purchases for iOS users happen on your website. They can browse products in the app but clicking "purchase" redirects them to the web portal to complete payment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I direct people to web or app first?">
    Always direct new users to your website first to create accounts and handle initial payments. After that, they can use the mobile app for daily access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips for athlete onboarding

<Tip>
  **Create an onboarding checklist**: Include steps like:

  1. Visit website and create account
  2. Purchase membership/credits
  3. Download app (with App Store links)
  4. Log in with web credentials
  5. Enable push notifications
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Bulk import existing clients**: Use **People** → **Import** to add multiple athletes at once, giving them instant app access without the sign-up friction.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set clear expectations**: Add a FAQ to your website explaining why iOS users must sign up via web. Frame it as "avoiding Apple's fees keeps your costs lower."
</Tip>
