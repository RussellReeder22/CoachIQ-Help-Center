## What you'll accomplish

Set up and organize your training programs, certifications, and resources so athletes can easily access content from their mobile app or web portal. You'll learn how to create sections, control access levels, and optimize the layout for maximum engagement.

## Before you begin

<Note>
  You'll need at least one program created in your CoachIQ admin before you can display it in the Athlete Portal.

  To create programs, go to **Content ‚Üí Programs** in your main admin dashboard.
</Note>

## Understanding the Programs page

The Programs page in your Athlete Portal is where athletes discover and access all your training content, certifications, and educational resources.

### Key differences from sessions

- **Programs are content**: Videos, lessons, and certifications that athletes complete at their own pace
- **Sessions are bookings**: Scheduled training times that athletes reserve
- **Programs show progress**: Athletes see completion percentages as they work through materials
- **Sessions show availability**: Athletes see when they can book time with you

### What athletes see

When athletes open the Programs page, they'll see:

- Program thumbnails with visual previews
- Lesson and media counts (e.g., "2 lessons ‚Ä¢ 1 media")
- Their completion progress for started programs
- Clear organization by sections you create

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where do I create new programs?">
    Programs are created in **Content ‚Üí Programs** in your main admin dashboard, not in the App Builder. The App Builder only controls which existing programs are displayed to athletes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't athletes see certain programs?">
    Check these common issues:

    1. The Programs page might be deactivated (check the Active toggle)
    2. The program might be set to Private without athlete assignment
    3. The program might be paywalled and the athlete hasn't purchased access
    4. The athlete might be viewing on iOS/Android where purchase restrictions apply
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes search or filter programs?">
    No, athletes cannot currently search within programs. They see all programs organized in the sections you create. Plan your section structure carefully to help athletes find content easily.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does progress tracking work?">
    Athletes see a completion percentage based on the lessons and media they've viewed. Each completed lesson or media file counts toward the total. For example, if a program has 10 items and an athlete completes 5, they'll see "50% complete."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I assign different programs to different athletes?">
    Yes! Use the Private program setting to make programs visible only to specific athletes you assign. This is perfect for personalized training plans or exclusive content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do sections collapse or expand?">
    No, sections are always expanded and visible. Athletes see all programs within each section immediately, which makes browsing easier on mobile devices.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Programs not appearing in selection modal

- **Check creation**: Ensure programs exist in Content ‚Üí Programs
- **Verify status**: Confirm programs are published, not draft
- **Refresh page**: Try refreshing the App Builder page

### Athletes report missing programs

- **Verify activation**: Check that the Programs page Active toggle is ON
- **Review access**: Confirm the program isn't set to Private
- **Check payments**: For paywalled programs, verify athlete has purchased access
- **iOS/Android limits**: Remember that app stores restrict in-app purchases

### Thumbnails not displaying correctly

- **Image requirements**: Thumbnails are set in the Program Builder
- **Cannot override**: Thumbnails cannot be changed in the App Builder
- **Aspect ratio**: Ensure images are properly sized in the original program

### Section organization issues

- **Drag and drop**: Ensure you're clicking and holding the drag handle
- **Browser compatibility**: Try a different browser if reordering isn't working
- **Save changes**: Always click Update Page after reorganizing

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Organization strategy**: Structure your sections by learning path:

  1. Fundamentals (beginners start here)
  2. Skill Development (intermediate content)
  3. Advanced Training (expert level)
  4. Certifications (achievement-based)
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Welcome Section power**: Use your Welcome Section to guide new athletes. Feature an orientation program that explains how to use your training system and what to expect.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Naming conventions**: Use clear, consistent naming:

  - Include skill level: "Beginner: Ball Handling Basics"
  - Add duration estimates: "30-Day Shooting Program"
  - Specify outcomes: "Master the Triple Threat"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Private program strategy**: Create exclusive programs for different athlete tiers:

  - Elite athletes get advanced tactical training
  - Youth athletes get age-appropriate fundamentals
  - Competition teams get game-prep content
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Regular audits**: Monthly, review your programs to:

  - Archive outdated content
  - Update section organization based on athlete feedback
  - Check completion rates to identify popular programs
  - Ensure free/paid balance aligns with your business model
