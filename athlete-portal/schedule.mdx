## What you'll accomplish

Set up and organize your schedulers so athletes can view available sessions and book directly from their mobile app or web portal. You'll learn how to select which schedulers appear, organize them into sections, and customize how they're displayed to your athletes.

## Before you begin

![Schedulerahtleteportal Pn](/images/schedulerahtleteportal.png)

<Note>
  **Required setup**: You must have at least one scheduler created before adding it to the Athlete Portal. If you haven't created any schedulers yet, go to **Schedule → Schedulers** to set up your first one.
</Note>

## Understanding the Schedule page

The Schedule page in your Athlete Portal is where athletes view and book available sessions. As a coach, you have complete control over:

- Which schedulers athletes can see
- How schedulers are organized into sections
- The titles and descriptions athletes see
- Whether the scheduling feature is available at all

Each scheduler displays its cost (like "1 Credit") which you set when creating the scheduler. This helps athletes understand the booking cost before they select a session.

## Accessing your Schedule settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to App Builder">
    From your dashboard, click **App** in the left navigation menu, then select **Schedule**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the Schedule page">
    You'll see any existing sections and schedulers already added to your athlete portal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate the Schedule page">
    Toggle the **Active** switch to control whether athletes can see the Schedule page. When off, the entire scheduling section is hidden from athletes.

## Adding schedulers to your portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Schedule">
    Within any section, click the **\+ Add Schedule** button to add a scheduler.

    ![Addschedulertoathleteapp Pn](/images/Addschedulertoathleteapp.png)
  </Step>

    ![Selectschedulertoaddtoathleteportal Pn](/images/selectschedulertoaddtoathleteportal.png)

    <Tip>
      You can select multiple schedulers at once or add them one at a time.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm your selection">
    Click **Add Selected** to add the chosen schedulers to your section. They'll appear immediately with their title, description, and credit cost.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating and organizing sections

Sections help you organize schedulers into logical groups like "Elite Program", "Rising Stars", or by location. Athletes always see sections expanded - they cannot collapse them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a new section">
    Click **\+ Add Section** at the bottom of your scheduler list.

    ![Addsectioninschedulersto Athleteapp Pn](/images/AddsectioninschedulerstoAthleteapp.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your section">
    Enter a clear, descriptive title for the section (e.g., "Beginner Classes", "Advanced Training", "Summer Programs").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add schedulers to the section">
    Click **\+ Add Schedule** within your new section to start adding schedulers.

    <Check>
      Your section is created and ready for schedulers!
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing scheduler display

Each scheduler can have a custom title and description that athletes see, regardless of the scheduler's original name.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on a scheduler">
    Select any scheduler in your list to open its editing panel.

    ![Editdescriptionandtitleforschedulersonathleteportal Pn](/images/Editdescriptionandtitleforschedulersonathleteportal.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the title">
    Update the scheduler name that athletes will see. Make it clear and action-oriented.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the description">
    Add helpful context about the session type, skill level, or what athletes should expect. Keep it concise but informative.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reordering and managing sections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access section controls">
    Click the dots menu (⋮) next to any section to see management options.

    ![Move&deletesectionswithinschedulersonathleteportal Pn](/images/Move&Deletesectionswithinschedulersonathleteportal.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder sections">
    Drag sections up or down to change their display order. Place your most popular or important sections at the top.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete sections">
    Select the delete option to remove an entire section and all its schedulers from the athlete view.

    <Warning>
      Deleting a section from the Athlete Portal doesn't delete the actual schedulers - it just removes them from athlete view.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Previewing the athlete experience

Always preview your changes to ensure athletes see exactly what you intend.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the preview button">

    - The overall organization makes sense for athletes

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where do I create new schedulers?">
    Schedulers are created in **Schedule → Schedulers** in your main dashboard. The Athlete Portal only controls which existing schedulers are visible to athletes. [Learn how to create schedulers →](/schedule/schedulers)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't my athletes see certain schedulers?">
    Check that:

    1. The Schedule page is set to **Active**
    2. The scheduler is added to a section in the Athlete Portal
    3. The scheduler has available time slots configured
    4. The athlete has the required credits or payment method
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do credits work with bookings?">
    The credit amount shown (e.g., "1 Credit") is the cost to book that session. Athletes must have sufficient credits in their account to book. Credits are set when creating the scheduler, not in the Athlete Portal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I show different schedulers to different athlete groups?">
    Currently, all athletes see the same schedulers. To control access, use the scheduler's internal settings for prerequisites or eligibility requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do changes appear immediately?">
    Yes! All changes to the Athlete Portal update instantly. There's no draft mode or publish button - athletes see updates as soon as you make them.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
  **Schedulers not appearing in selection modal?**
  Make sure you've created schedulers in **Schedule → Schedulers** first. The Athlete Portal can only display schedulers that already exist in your system.
</Warning>

### Common issues and solutions

**Athletes can't see the Schedule page:**

- Verify the Active toggle is turned on
- Check that at least one scheduler is added
- Ensure athletes are logged into their accounts

**Credit amounts showing incorrectly:**

- Credits are set in the scheduler configuration, not in the Athlete Portal
- Go to **Schedule → Schedulers** to update credit costs

**Sections appearing in wrong order:**

- Use the dots menu (⋮) to drag and reorder sections
- Changes save automatically

**Scheduler descriptions not updating:**

- Click directly on the scheduler to open edit mode
- Make sure to click outside the field to save changes

## Pro tips

  **Organization best practices:**

  - Group schedulers by program level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
