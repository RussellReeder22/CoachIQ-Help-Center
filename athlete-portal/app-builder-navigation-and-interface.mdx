## Understanding the App Builder layout

The App Builder uses a three-panel interface that gives you complete control over your athlete portal:

<Step title="Access the main pages">
Use the left sidebar to navigate between the four core pages:

<Frame caption="Settings section in the App Builder sidebar">
<img src="/images/athleteportalcoachesside.png" alt="App Builder settings navigation" />
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Working with sections and items

Each page in your athlete portal is built using a section-based architecture:

### Adding new sections

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your desired page">
Click on Schedule, Content, or Products in the left sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Click 'Add Section'">
Find the **Add Section** button in the content area to create a new category.

<Frame caption="Adding sections and schedulers to organize your content">
<img src="/images/addingschedulerandsections.png" alt="Add Section and Add Scheduler buttons in the Schedule page" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure your section">
- Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Rising Stars", "Elite Program")
- Add a description for clarity
- Set credit requirements if applicable
</Step>
</Steps>

### Adding items to sections

Within each section, you can add specific items:

- **Schedule page**: Add schedulers (booking sessions)
- **Content page**: Add programs (courses/training)
- **Products page**: Add products (memberships/packages)

<Tip>
**Organization tip**: Name your sections based on how athletes will understand them - by location ("Downtown Gym"), by level ("Beginner Classes"), or by type ("Private Training").
</Tip>

## Understanding the preview system

The App Builder shows you exactly what athletes will see:

<Frame caption="Compare what coaches configure (left) vs what athletes see (right)">
<img src="/images/athleteviewsectionsandschedulers.png" alt="Athlete view showing sections and schedulers as they appear in the app" />
</Frame>

<Note>
The athlete view (shown above) displays your sections as cards with:
- Section name and description
- Credit requirements
- "Book Now" or "Learn More" buttons
- Professional, branded appearance
</Note>

## Page controls and settings

### Activating pages

Each page must be activated before athletes can see it:

<Steps>
<Step title="Toggle the Active switch">
Use the **Active** toggle in the top bar to enable/disable the entire page.

<Frame caption="The Active toggle controls whether athletes can see this page">
<img src="/images/setpageasactiveathleteportal.png" alt="Active toggle switch in the App Builder" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure visibility in Menu & Links">
Even with a page active, you control its visibility through Settings → Menu & Links.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Page-specific settings

Click the settings icons in the top bar to access:

<Frame caption="Page settings options for additional configuration">

</Warning>

<Steps>

<img src="/images/updateathleteportal.png" alt="Update Page button highlighted in the App Builder" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the update">
The button will briefly show "Updating..." then return to normal when complete.

<Check>
**Success!** Your changes are now live for all athletes across web and mobile apps.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common interface patterns

### The toggle hierarchy

The App Builder uses three levels of toggles:

1. **Page level**: Active toggle (entire page on/off)
2. **Menu level**: Settings → Menu & Links (navigation visibility)
3. **Section level**: Individual section toggles (show/hide sections)

### Visual indicators

- **Gray text**: Descriptions and helper text
- **Credit badges**: Show credit requirements clearly
- **Trash icons**: Remove sections or items
- **Drag handles**: Reorder sections (where available)

## Pro tips for navigation

<Tip>
**Organization tip**: Start with one page at a time. Complete and test each page fully before moving to the next.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Testing tip**: Always preview your changes before publishing, especially when managing multiple sections.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why can't athletes see my changes?">
You need to click "Update Page" to publish changes. Also verify:
- The page Active toggle is ON
- The page is enabled in Menu & Links settings
- Athletes have refreshed their app
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I undo changes after updating?">
There's no undo function, but you can:
- Manually revert changes
- Use the Copy Page feature to backup configurations
- Contact support for assistance with major issues
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know which sections athletes can see?">
Check three things:
1. Page Active toggle (must be ON)
2. Menu & Links visibility settings
3. Individual section settings and paywall configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between sections and schedulers?">
- **Sections**: Categories that group similar items (like "Elite Training")
- **Schedulers**: Actual bookable sessions within sections (like "Tuesday 6pm Elite Class")
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
