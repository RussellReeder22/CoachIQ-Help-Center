Programs are the top-level container for everything you deliver to athletes. They're how you package your lessons, videos, and training content into structured courses that athletes access through the CoachIQ app. Think of programs as the "product" athletes actually see and work through.

<Info>
  **Where to find Programs**: Dashboard → Content → Programs
</Info>

## Why programs matter

While Media Hub stores your content and Lesson Builder creates interactive experiences, Programs are what athletes actually access. Key points:

- **Athletes only see Programs**—they never access your Media Hub or raw lessons directly
- **Programs can be sold** as paid products or shared free
- **Programs track progress**—you see who's completed what
- **Programs collect responses**—quiz answers, form submissions, and uploads all live here

<Tip>
  Think of it like this: Media Hub is your filing cabinet, Lessons are your worksheets, and Programs are the course binder you hand to students.
</Tip>

## How to create a training program

</Frame>

### Center area - Visual flow builder

This is where you build your program structure:

- **Starting Block** (purple): Visual entry point, always present
- **Lesson nodes** (orange/red): Interactive lessons you've added
- **Media nodes** (blue): Standalone videos or images

Click any node to select it and see options.

<Frame>
  ![Programs Center Ui](/images/programs-center-ui.png)
</Frame>

<Frame>
  ![Programs Right Panel](/images/programs-right-panel.png)
</Frame>

## Adding content to your program

### Adding standalone media

3. Drag the media button into the visual flow area
4. Drop it in position
2. Find the video or image you want

### Adding lessons

3. Drag the lesson button into the visual flow area
4. Drop it where you want it in the sequence
2. Find the lesson you want to add

<Note>
  **Mixed content**: Programs can contain any combination of lessons and standalone media. Use lessons for interactive content and standalone media for simple video chapters that don't need quizzes or text overlays.
</Note>

### Reordering content

Drag nodes up or down in the visual flow to change their order. Athletes will progress through content in the order shown (top to bottom).

### Removing content

1. Click on any node in the visual flow
2. Click **Remove** in the popup menu
3. The content is removed from the program (but not deleted from Media Hub)

## Working with program nodes

When you click on a node in the visual flow, you'll see:

| Option                | What it does                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Preview thumbnail** | Shows the content preview                    |
| **Edit Lesson**       | Opens Lesson Builder directly (lessons only) |
| **Thumbnail**         | Change the chapter thumbnail                 |
| **Remove**            | Remove from program                          |
| **Access dropdown**   | Set when this chapter unlocks                |

<Tip>
  **Quick editing**: Click "Edit Lesson" on any lesson node to jump directly into the Lesson Builder. Save your lesson changes there, then return to the Program Builder.
</Tip>

## Progression modes: How athletes move through content

Click **Complete & Progress** (or **Change** next to it) in the top bar to choose how athletes progress through your program.

### Immediate Access

**How it works**: All content is available immediately. Athletes can access any chapter in any order.

**Best for**:

- Reference libraries
- On-demand content collections
- Programs where order doesn't matter
- Returning athletes who need to jump to specific sections

### Complete & Progress

**How it works**: Athletes must complete each chapter before the next one unlocks. They work through content sequentially.

**Best for**:

- Structured courses with building concepts
- Certification programs
- Training progressions where order matters
- Ensuring athletes don't skip foundational content

<Note>
  "Complete" means the athlete has fully viewed/finished the lesson or media—not just opened it. They need to swipe through all slides or watch the video.
</Note>

### Drip

**How it works**: Content releases on a time-based schedule. You configure how frequently new chapters unlock (daily, weekly, or custom intervals).

**Best for**:

- Email-course style content delivery
- Subscription programs with ongoing content
- Pacing athletes to prevent rushing through material
- Building anticipation and engagement over time

## Previewing your program

Click the **Preview** button (play icon) in the top bar to see exactly what athletes will experience:

- Program thumbnail and title
- Chapter list with progress indicators
- Lesson preview with slide count
- "Begin Program" button

This is the same view athletes see in their app. Use it to verify your content looks correct before sharing.

## Viewing program stats

Click the **Stats** button in the top bar to see:

- **All Checkpoints**: Overview of all chapters
- **View counts**: How many athletes viewed each chapter
- **Quiz responses**: What athletes selected on multiple choice questions
- **Form responses**: What athletes typed in free-text fields
- **Upload submissions**: Files athletes submitted through Upload elements

<Info>
  Stats are collected at the program level, even if the same lesson appears in multiple programs. Each program tracks its own responses separately.

    Plan your chapter structure before building. Know what content goes where and in what order.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mix content types" icon="shuffle">
    Combine interactive lessons with standalone videos for variety. Not everything needs to be a full lesson.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use clear thumbnails" icon="image">
    Each chapter thumbnail helps athletes navigate. Use distinct images that represent the content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Save frequently" icon="floppy-disk">

## Frequently asked questions about programs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add the same lesson to multiple programs?">
    Yes! Lessons can be reused across unlimited programs. This is great for foundational content that applies to multiple courses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between a lesson and standalone media in a program?">
    **Lessons** are interactive, multi-slide experiences with text, quizzes, forms, etc. **Standalone media** is just a single video or image—athletes watch/view it and move on. Use lessons when you want interaction, standalone media when you just need to share a video.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the progression mode after athletes have started?">
    Yes, but be careful. Changing from Complete & Progress to Immediate Access will unlock all content for everyone. Changing the other direction may lock content athletes previously had access to.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I see which athletes completed my program?">
    Click the **Stats** button in the Program Builder. You'll see view counts and can track which chapters athletes have completed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many chapters a program can have?">
    No limit. Add as many lessons and media files as you need. However, very long programs may benefit from being split into multiple programs or "levels."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my lesson in the sidebar?">
    Lessons must be saved in the Lesson Builder before they appear in the Program Builder. Make sure you clicked "Update Lesson" after creating it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a lesson that's in a program?">
    The lesson will be removed from any programs that included it. Always check where a lesson is used before deleting it from Media Hub.
  </Accordion>
