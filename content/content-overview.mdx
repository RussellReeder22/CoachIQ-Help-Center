The Content section of CoachIQ is where you create, organize, and deliver online training programs to your athletes. Whether you're building follow-along workout videos, digital coaching courses, or skill development content—this is your hub for creating and selling training content that athletes access through the CoachIQ app.

## How online coaching content works in CoachIQ

Think of CoachIQ's content system like building an online course: you gather your training videos and images (Media Hub), create engaging interactive lessons (Lesson Builder), and package everything into a training program your athletes can access (Programs).

Here's the key insight: **Athletes only see Programs**. They never access your Media Hub or see your raw lessons—they experience the polished, packaged program you've created for them.

## How to create training content for athletes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload your media">
    Add videos, images, and training content to your Media Hub. Organize with tags for easy access later.

    _Example: Upload 10 shooting drill videos and tag them "Shooting Drills"_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create lessons (optional but powerful)">
    Build interactive lessons using your media. Add text overlays, quizzes, buttons, and even let athletes upload their own videos for review.

    _Example: Create a "Shooting Form Basics" lesson with 5 slides—video demo, key points, quiz, and upload prompt_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your program">
    Combine lessons and standalone media into a structured program. Set the order, choose how content unlocks, and decide on pricing.

    _Example: Create "30-Day Shooting Program" with 10 lessons and 5 bonus drill videos_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share with athletes">
    Publish your program as free, paid, or private. Athletes access it through their app and work through the content.

    _Example: Sell access for \$49, or assign it free to your current training clients_
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How athletes access your training programs

When an athlete opens your program in their app, they see:

- **Program overview**: Your thumbnail, title, and chapter list
- **Progress tracking**: Which chapters they've completed (e.g., "3 of 10 complete")
- **Lesson experience**: Swipeable, Instagram Stories-style content they tap through
- **Interactive elements**: Quizzes to answer, forms to fill out, videos to watch

<Note>
  Athletes navigate between lessons by completing each one. If you set your program to "Complete & Progress" mode, they must finish each chapter before the next one unlocks—perfect for structured courses.
</Note>

## Understanding Media Hub, Lessons, and Programs

### Media Hub

Your central storage for all images and videos. Key things to know:

- **Supports all file types** except PDFs
- **Unlimited storage**—no caps on how much you can upload
- **Tag-based organization**—create nested tags like "Drills → Shooting → Layups"
- **Direct integration**—pull media into lessons and programs with a click

<Frame>
  ![Media Hub Example](/images/media-hub-example.png)
</Frame>

### Lessons

Interactive, slide-based content your athletes swipe through. Each lesson can include:

| Element    | What it does                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Media**  | Video or image from your Media Hub                      |
| **Text**   | Customizable text overlays with colors and backgrounds  |
| **Button** | Navigate to next slide, open a link, or download a file |
| **Quiz**   | Multiple choice questions for engagement                |
| **Form**   | Free-text input for athlete responses                   |
| **Upload** | Let athletes upload their own videos or images          |

<Tip>
  The **Upload** element is powerful for remote coaching. Athletes can submit videos of themselves performing drills, and you can review their form and provide feedback.
</Tip>

### Programs

The container that holds everything together. Programs can include:

- **Lessons** (interactive, multi-slide content)
- **Standalone media** (individual videos or images)
- **Any mix of both**

You control how athletes progress through programs:

| Mode                    | How it works                                           | Best for                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate Access**    | All content available at once                          | Reference libraries, on-demand content   |
| **Complete & Progress** | Must finish each chapter to unlock next                | Structured courses, certifications       |
| **Drip**                | Content releases on a schedule (daily, weekly, custom) | Email-course style, subscription content |

## How to sell or share your coaching programs

Every program can be configured with different access levels:

| Option        | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**      | Anyone can access without payment                                |
| **Paywalled** | Requires purchase of a linked product (one-time or subscription) |
| **Private**   | Only assigned users can see and access it                        |

You can combine these—for example, a paywalled program that's also privately assigned to specific athletes.

<Info>
  **Connecting to payments**: When you paywall a program, you link it to one or more Products you've created in CoachIQ. Any athlete who purchases that product automatically gets access to the program.

## Ways coaches use digital training content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sell an online training course">
    Create a program with structured lessons covering your training methodology. Set it to "Complete & Progress" so athletes work through content in order. Paywall it with a one-time purchase price or monthly subscription.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deliver bonus content to in-person clients">
    Upload workout videos and create programs your current athletes can access for free. Set programs to private and assign them to specific clients. They get at-home workouts that complement their in-person sessions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run a video analysis service">
    Create lessons with an Upload element where athletes submit videos of themselves. Review their submissions and provide feedback through the platform. Great for remote coaching or form checks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build a certification program">
    Structure lessons with quizzes and forms to assess understanding. Use "Complete & Progress" mode so athletes must pass each section. Track completion through program stats.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for creating online coaching content

<Warning>
  **No auto-save in builders**: Both the Lesson Builder and Program Builder require you to manually save your work. Click "Update Lesson" or "Update Program" frequently to avoid losing changes.
</Warning>

**Quick tips for success:**

- **Start with media**: Upload your videos and images first. Everything else builds on your media library.
- **Keep lessons focused**: Each lesson should cover one concept or drill. It's better to have more short lessons than fewer long ones.
- **Test as an athlete**: Use the preview feature to see exactly what athletes will experience before publishing.
- **Organize with tags**: Good tagging in Media Hub makes building lessons and programs much faster.

## Frequently asked questions about CoachIQ content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to create lessons, or can I just add videos to a program?">
    You can do either! Programs support both interactive lessons AND standalone media files. If you just want to share a collection of videos, add them directly as media. If you want a more engaging experience with text, quizzes, and athlete uploads, create lessons.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes download my videos?">
    By default, athletes stream content—they don't download it. If you want to provide downloadable files, use a Button element in a lesson with the "downloadable link" option.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where do quiz and form responses go?">
    All responses from quizzes and forms within lessons are collected at the program level. You can view them in the Stats section of your Program Builder.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same lesson in multiple programs?">
    Yes! Once you create a lesson, it appears in your Media Hub and can be added to any program. This is great for reusing foundational content across different courses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Media Hub and Google Drive?">
    Media Hub is your replacement for Google Drive within CoachIQ. It's built specifically for coaching content—easier to organize, directly integrates with lessons and programs, and your athletes access content through a professional app experience rather than shared links.
