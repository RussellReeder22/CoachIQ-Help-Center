## Getting started with Video Analysis

### How to create a video analysis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a video from Media Hub">
    Go to **Content → Media Hub** and find the video you want to analyze. Click on it to open the expanded view.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create Video">
    In the action menu, click **Create Video**. This launches the Video Analysis tool with your selected video loaded.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your recording settings">
    Before recording, set up your camera and microphone:
    - Select your **camera source** from available devices
    - Select your **microphone source** from available devices
    - Choose your **video resolution** (1080p, 720p, 480p, or 240p)
    - Set your **camera overlay** style (off, circle, or square)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Record your analysis">
    Click the record button to start. As the video plays, speak your commentary and use drawing tools to annotate key moments.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and export">

### Recording options

| **Camera source** | Your connected cameras | Select your preferred webcam |
| **Microphone** | Your connected mics | Select your best audio input |

## Keyboard shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with these keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **F** | Add annotation/drawing |
| **A** | Toggle slow-motion playback |
| **T** | Add text overlay |
| **W** | Previous slide |
| **S** | Next slide |

<Note>
**Slow motion (A key)** is perfect for breaking down fast movements—use it to analyze technique frame by frame.
</Note>

---

## Annotation and markup tools

### Adding annotations

Annotations help athletes see exactly what you're talking about. To add an annotation:

1. Press **F** or click the annotation tool
2. Click anywhere on the video to place your annotation point
3. Type your commentary or note
4. Press **Enter** to save

### Drawing on video

Use drawing tools to highlight:
- Body positioning and alignment
- Movement paths and trajectories  
- Areas that need correction
- Proper technique demonstrations

<Tip>
**Create a consistent system**: Use the same colors or symbols for similar feedback types. For example, green for "good" and red for "needs work" helps athletes quickly understand your markup.
</Tip>

### Text overlays

Press **T** to add text overlays for:
- Play descriptions
- Technical instructions
- Key teaching points
- Section titles

---

## Camera overlay (picture-in-picture)

The camera overlay puts your face on screen while the analysis video plays—perfect for building connection with remote athletes.

### Overlay options

| Style | Appearance | When to use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Off** | No camera visible | When you want athletes to focus entirely on the video |
| **Circle** | Round camera frame | Clean, modern look for coaching commentary |
| **Square** | Rectangular frame | Traditional picture-in-picture style |

### Face-to-face feedback benefits

- **Personal connection**: Athletes see you, not just hear you
- **Non-verbal cues**: Your expressions add context to feedback
- **Remote coaching**: Replicates in-person review sessions
- **Trust building**: More engaging than voiceover alone

---

## Working with slides

Video Analysis supports multi-slide projects, letting you break down different aspects of performance in separate segments.

### Managing slides

- **Add slide**: Create a new slide for a different video clip or section
- **Remove slide**: Delete slides you no longer need
- **Reorder slides**: Drag slides to change their sequence
- **Navigate**: Use **W** (previous) and **S** (next) to move between slides

### When to use multiple slides

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Before/after comparison">
    Slide 1: Athlete's current technique with annotations showing issues.
    Slide 2: Example of correct technique for comparison.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Segmented feedback">
    Slide 1: Approach and setup analysis.
    Slide 2: Execution breakdown.
    Slide 3: Follow-through review.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple athletes">
    Create separate slides for each athlete in a group session, then export as one comprehensive video.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Progress tracking">
    Slide 1: Footage from last month.
    Slide 2: Current footage showing improvement.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for effective video analysis

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep it focused" icon="bullseye">
    Limit each analysis to 2-3 key points. Too much feedback overwhelms athletes.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Be specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Instead of "fix your form," say "bend your knees 10 degrees more at this point."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Balance critique with praise" icon="scale-balanced">
    Point out what's working well, not just what needs improvement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use visual cues" icon="draw-polygon">
    Draw lines, circles, and arrows—visual markup is clearer than verbal description alone.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Quality checklist

Before exporting, verify:
- [ ] Audio is clear and at consistent volume
- [ ] Camera overlay (if used) doesn't cover important video content
- [ ] Annotations are readable and positioned well
- [ ] Slides are in logical order
- [ ] Key points are clearly communicated

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Camera or microphone not working">
    Check browser permissions. Your browser needs permission to access your camera and microphone. Look for a camera icon in your browser's address bar and ensure access is allowed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Video not loading in the editor">
    Refresh the page and try again. If the issue persists, check your internet connection or try a different browser.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Export is taking too long">
    Longer videos and higher resolutions take more time to process. For faster exports, try 720p instead of 1080p.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Camera overlay not appearing">
    Verify your camera is connected and selected in the settings. Try toggling the overlay option off and back on.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio out of sync">
    This can happen with slower computers. Try closing other applications to free up processing power, or export at a lower resolution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
