Once you've built a program, you need to make it available to athletes. This involves two steps: configuring your pricing and access settings, then publishing the program to your Athlete Portal so athletes can actually see it.

<Note>
**Two steps to share a program**: 
1. Configure Share settings (Free/Paywalled, Public/Private) in the Program Builder
2. Add the program to your Athlete Portal to make it live
</Note>

## Publishing programs to your Athlete Portal

The Athlete Portal is your branded app where athletes access your content. For athletes to see any program, you must add it to the portal's Programs section.

<Info>
**Where to find the Athlete Portal**: Dashboard → Website & App → Athlete Portal → Click **Edit**
</Info>

### How to add programs to your portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Athlete Portal editor">
    From your dashboard, go to **Website & App** and find the **Athlete Portal** section. Click **Edit** to open the portal builder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go to the Content tab">
    In the portal editor, click the **Content** tab. This is where you manage which programs appear in your athlete app.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add your programs">
    Select the programs you want to make available. Only programs added here will appear in the athlete app.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save your portal">
    Save your changes. The programs will now be visible to athletes in the app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What athletes see in the app

When athletes open your app, they see a **Programs** section in the sidebar with two categories:

| Section | What appears here |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Available** | Public programs anyone can access or purchase |
| **Shared with you** | Private programs specifically assigned to that athlete |

<Tip>
**The portal is your control center**: You have complete control over what appears in your athlete app. You can add or remove programs, schedulers, products, and communication channels—all from the Athlete Portal editor.
</Tip>

---

## Understanding pricing and access options

Once a program is added to your Athlete Portal, you control *who* can access it through Share settings in the Program Builder.

<Info>
**Where to find share settings**: Open any program in the Program Builder → Click **Share** in the top bar
</Info>

Every program has two independent settings you can combine:

| Setting | Options | What it controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Price** | Free or Paywalled | Whether payment is required |
| **Visibility** | Public or Private | Who can see and access the program |

This creates four possible combinations:

| Configuration | Who can access |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Free + Public** | Anyone on the athlete app |
| **Free + Private** | Only athletes you specifically assign |
| **Paywalled + Public** | Anyone who purchases a linked product |
| **Paywalled + Private** | Only assigned athletes who also purchase |

## How to configure program sharing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open share settings">
    In the Program Builder, click the **Share** button in the top bar. The share settings panel opens on the left.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your price">
    Choose between:
    - **Free**: No payment required
    - **Paywalled**: Requires purchase to access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure visibility (optional)">
    Toggle **Private program** on if you want to restrict access to specific athletes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete additional settings">
    Depending on your choices:
    - **If Paywalled**: Select which products unlock this program
    - **If Private**: Search and assign specific athletes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save your settings">
    Click **Save** to apply your share configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Free programs

Free programs don't require any payment. Athletes can access them without purchasing anything.

### Setting up a free program

1. Click **Share** in the Program Builder
2. Select the **Free** tab
3. Click **Save**

That's it—your program is now free for all athletes to access.

## Paywalled programs

Paywalled programs require athletes to purchase a product before accessing the content. This is how you monetize your training programs.

### How paywalling works

1. You create **Products** in CoachIQ (one-time purchases or subscriptions)
2. You link those products to your program
3. When an athlete purchases any linked product, they automatically get access to the program

<Note>
**Products come first**: You must create at least one Product in CoachIQ before you can paywall a program. Products are created in the Payments section of your dashboard.
</Note>

### Setting up a paywalled program

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open share settings">
    Click **Share** in the Program Builder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Paywalled">
    Click the **Paywalled** tab. You'll see the message: "A product you will deliver to your customer on a per order basis"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select products">
    Under **Select Products**, you'll see your existing CoachIQ products with their prices. Click to select which products unlock this program.
    
    *Example: Select "Bronze Package - $200/month" and "Trial Class - $10"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply the paywall.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multiple products can unlock one program

You can link multiple products to a single program. Purchasing **any** of the selected products grants access.

**Why this is useful:**

| Scenario | How to set it up |
|----------|------------------|
| **Tiered pricing** | Link both "Basic" ($49) and "Premium" ($99) products—both get access to this program, but Premium includes other benefits |
| **Bundle deals** | Link your "Complete Training Bundle" product so buyers get this program plus others |
| **Subscription + one-time** | Link both your monthly subscription and a one-time purchase option |

<Tip>
**Pricing strategy**: Create different products at different price points, then link the appropriate ones to each program. This lets you offer flexible purchasing options without duplicating programs.
</Tip>

---

## Private programs

Private programs are only visible to athletes you specifically assign. Other athletes won't see the program in their app at all.

### Setting up a private program

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open share settings">
    Click **Share** in the Program Builder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable private mode">
    Toggle on **Private program**. You'll see the description: "Directly assign to students"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign athletes">
    Use the search field to find athletes by:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Phone number
    
    Click on an athlete to add them to the access list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply. Only assigned athletes will see this program.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing assigned athletes

- **Add more**: Search and click to add additional athletes
- **Remove access**: Click the X next to an athlete's name to remove them
- **View current list**: Assigned athletes appear with their profile photos in the settings panel

### When to use private programs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Personalized training plans">
    Create custom programs for individual athletes with content specific to their needs. Only they can see it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Team-specific content">

</Warning>

## The program preview card

As you configure share settings, the preview card on the right shows how your program will appear:

| Element | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Thumbnail** | Your program cover image |
| **Title** | Program name |
| **Status badges** | "Paywalled" if paid, "Private (X users)" if private |
| **Assigned users** | Profile photos of assigned athletes (if private) |

## Frequently asked questions about sharing and pricing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I configured Share settings but athletes can't see my program. What's wrong?">
    You need to add the program to your **Athlete Portal**. Go to Website & App → Athlete Portal → Edit → Content, and add the program there. Share settings control *who* can access a program, but the Athlete Portal controls *whether* it appears in the app at all.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Share settings and the Athlete Portal?">
    **Share settings** (in Program Builder) control pricing and visibility—Free vs Paywalled, Public vs Private. The **Athlete Portal** (in Website & App) controls what actually appears in your athlete app. You need both: configure Share settings, then add to the portal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I change pricing after athletes have already purchased?">
    You can change which products are linked to a program at any time. Athletes who already purchased keep their access. New athletes need to purchase based on the current configuration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I switch from Paywalled to Free?">
    The program becomes free for everyone. Athletes who previously paid still have access (they just didn't need to pay anymore). All future access is free.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can one product unlock multiple programs?">
    Yes! When you create a product, you can link it to multiple programs. This is how bundles work—one purchase, access to many programs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I remove someone's access to a private program?">
    Open Share settings, find the athlete in the assigned list, and click the X to remove them. Save your changes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to assign athletes if the program is public?">
    No. Public programs are visible to all athletes in the "Available" section. You only need to assign athletes when Private mode is enabled.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can athletes share or transfer their program access?">
    No. Access is tied to the individual athlete's account. They can't share login credentials or transfer access to someone else.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where do I create the Products that I link to programs?">
    Products are created in the **Payments** section of your dashboard, not in the Content section. Create your products there first, then link them to programs in Share settings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I remove a program from my Athlete Portal without deleting it?">
    Yes. Removing a program from the Athlete Portal just hides it from athletes—the program still exists in your Content section. You can add it back anytime.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
