Lessons are interactive, slide-based content your athletes swipe through—like Instagram Stories, but for coaching. Each lesson can combine videos, images, text, quizzes, and more into an engaging experience that goes beyond just watching a video.

<Info>
**Where to find Lessons**: Dashboard → Content → Media Hub → Create Lesson button
</Info>

## What makes lessons powerful

Unlike standalone videos, lessons let you:

- **Layer text and instructions** over your media
- **Add quizzes** to check athlete understanding
- **Collect written feedback** with form fields
- **Let athletes upload** their own videos for you to review
- **Guide navigation** with buttons and links
- **Create a structured experience** athletes complete slide by slide

<Tip>
**Best for**: Skill breakdowns, drill explanations, educational content, form checks, and any training that benefits from interaction beyond just "watch this video."
</Tip>

## How to create your first lesson

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Lesson Builder">
    Go to **Content → Media Hub** and click the **Create Lesson** button in the top right.
    
    You can also click **Copy Existing** to duplicate an existing lesson as a starting point.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set your lesson details">
    Click the **Settings** icon in the top bar to configure:
    
    - **Lesson Name**: What athletes will see (e.g., "Shooting Form Basics")
    - **Thumbnail**: The cover image shown in programs
    - **Tags**: For organizing in Media Hub
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add your first slide">
    Your lesson starts with one blank slide. Click on any element type in the toolbar to add content:
    
    - **Media**: Add a video or image from your Media Hub
    - **Text**: Add text overlays
    - **Button**: Add navigation or links
    - **Quiz**: Add multiple choice questions
    - **Form**: Add free-text input fields
    - **Upload**: Let athletes submit their own content
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add more slides">
    Click **Add Slide** at the bottom of the builder to create additional slides. Athletes will swipe left/right to navigate between them.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preview your lesson">
    Click the **Preview** button (play icon) in the top bar to see exactly what athletes will experience. Swipe or click arrows to navigate through slides.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save your lesson">
    Click **Update Lesson** (yellow button, top right) to save your work.
    
    <Warning>
    **Critical**: The Lesson Builder does NOT auto-save. If you navigate away without clicking Update Lesson, you will lose all unsaved changes.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Lesson Builder interface

The builder is divided into four main areas:

### Top bar

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **← Back** | Return to Media Hub (prompts to save if needed) |
| **Settings** | Lesson name, thumbnail, and tags |
| **Preview** (play icon) | See the lesson as athletes will experience it |
| **Update Lesson** | Save all changes (yellow button) |

### Left sidebar

Shows your lesson structure:
- **Lesson title** at the top
- **Slide list** showing each slide and its elements
- Expandable view to see what's on each slide
- Click any slide to select it for editing

### Center canvas

A mobile phone preview showing exactly how your current slide will appear to athletes. This is your main editing area—what you see is what athletes get.

### Right panel

Contextual settings for whatever element you have selected. Options change based on the element type (text color, button actions, quiz options, etc.).

## Working with slides

### Adding slides

Click **Add Slide** at the bottom of the builder. New slides appear at the end of your lesson.

### Reordering slides

Drag slides up or down in the left sidebar to change their order.

### Duplicating slides

Click the **duplicate icon** at the bottom of the canvas to copy the current slide. Useful when creating similar slides with minor variations.

### Deleting slides

Select a slide and click delete. Be careful—this cannot be undone without re-creating the slide.

<Note>
**No limit**: You can add unlimited slides to a single lesson. However, shorter, focused lessons (5-15 slides) typically perform better than very long ones.
</Note>

## The six lesson elements

Each slide can contain multiple elements layered on top of each other. Here's a quick overview:

| Element | Icon | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Media** | ▶ | Add videos or images from your Media Hub |
| **Text** | TT | Add customizable text overlays |
| **Button** | Grid | Navigation buttons, links, or file downloads |
| **Quiz** | 🤔 | Multiple choice questions |
| **Form** | 📋 | Free-text input fields |
| **Upload** | 📎 | Let athletes upload their own content |

<Info>
For detailed instructions on configuring each element, see the [Lesson Elements Guide](/content/lesson-elements).
</Info>

## How athletes experience lessons

When athletes open a lesson within a program, they see:

1. **A full-screen, mobile-optimized view** of your first slide
2. **Progress dots at the top** showing how many slides remain (like Instagram Stories)
3. **Swipe left/right** (or tap arrows) to navigate between slides
4. **Interactive elements** they can engage with—answer quizzes, fill forms, upload videos
5. **Completion tracking** so they know when they've finished

The experience feels native and modern—athletes are already familiar with this format from social media.

## Where lesson responses go

When athletes interact with your lesson elements:

| Element | Where responses go |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Quiz** | Collected in the parent Program's Stats |
| **Form** | Collected in the parent Program's Stats |
| **Upload** | Collected in the parent Program's Stats |

<Note>
Responses are tied to the Program, not the individual lesson. This means you access all athlete submissions from the Program Builder's Stats view.
</Note>

## Tips for creating effective lessons

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with media" icon="photo-film">
    Begin each slide with a video or image, then layer text and other elements on top. This creates visual interest and context.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Keep slides focused" icon="bullseye">
    One concept per slide. If you're explaining multiple things, split them across slides rather than cramming everything onto one.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use buttons for pacing" icon="computer-mouse">
    Add a "Next" button instead of relying on swipe navigation. This ensures athletes acknowledge each slide before moving on.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Save frequently" icon="floppy-disk">
    Click Update Lesson often while building. There's no auto-save, and losing 30 minutes of work is frustrating.

## Frequently asked questions about lessons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same lesson in multiple programs?">
    Yes! Once created, lessons appear in your Media Hub and can be added to any program. This is great for reusing foundational content across different courses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I edit an existing lesson?">
    In Media Hub, click on any lesson to open it. You can also access lessons from within a Program by clicking on the lesson node and selecting "Edit Lesson."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I add multiple elements to one slide?">
    Yes. Each slide can have unlimited elements layered on top of each other. For example, a video with a text overlay and a button at the bottom.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Quiz and Form?">
    **Quiz** provides multiple choice options—athletes tap to select their answer. **Form** provides a free-text field—athletes type their own response. Use Quiz for quick checks, Form for reflection and open-ended questions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are quizzes graded?">
    No. Quizzes in CoachIQ are for engagement and feedback collection, not formal assessment. There's no pass/fail or scoring—you simply see what athletes selected.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the Upload element for?">
    The Upload element lets athletes submit their own videos, images, or files. It's designed for them to upload content (like a video of themselves doing a drill), NOT for coaches to add content. Use the Media element to add your own videos and images.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did my changes disappear?">
    The Lesson Builder does not auto-save. If you navigated away or closed the browser without clicking "Update Lesson," your changes were not saved. Always save frequently while building.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
