## TL;DR: Your Facility Search Roadmap

**Timeline**: 6-12 months from research to signed lease

**Critical Path**:

1. **Prove demand first** (3-12 months training in rented space until revenue = 2x facility costs)
2. **Research exhaustively** (4 weeks: 10-15 competitors + 20-30 stakeholder conversations)
3. **Budget conservatively** ($40K-$100K total investment + 6-12 months reserves)
4. **Search patiently** (8-12 months: 3-5 brokers + tour 10-20+ properties)
5. **Negotiate everything** (rent, terms, improvements, exit strategy—all negotiable)

**Brandon's Results**: $70K self-funded, 4,700 sq ft at $4/sq ft (50% below market), 3-year lease, downtown Fort Wayne

**Biggest Mistake to Avoid**: Rushing major purchases (cost him $30-40K extra on flooring)

## What This Guide Covers

Opening a training facility is one of the biggest decisions you'll make as a coach. The difference between a thriving facility and one that closes within 18 months often comes down to the location decision—not just where you open, but how you validate demand, structure your search, and negotiate your lease.

This guide walks you through the systematic 6-12 month process to find, evaluate, and secure the perfect training facility location. You'll learn how to research competition, prove market demand before committing capital, understand real costs, navigate commercial leases, and avoid the expensive mistakes that sink new facilities.

**Who This Is For**: Coaches ready to transition from renting space to opening a dedicated facility, whether basketball, volleyball, baseball, or any sport-specific training business.

## Your Guide: Brandon Evans & Pro Standard Basketball Academy

Throughout this guide, we'll follow the real-world journey of **Brandon Evans**, founder of Pro Standard Basketball Academy in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Brandon is a Fort Wayne native who trained under Ryan Razooky in California—one of the largest basketball training programs in the country—before returning home with a mission to bring professional player development to his community.

What started as small group sessions under "Brandon Evans Basketball" has evolved into a 4,700 sq ft facility serving 75+ athletes weekly. Brandon's journey from church gyms to his own facility embodies every principle in this guide: he proved demand first, researched exhaustively, budgeted conservatively, and learned expensive lessons so you don't have to.

His philosophy—"Raise Your Standard"—isn't just a tagline. It's the systematic approach he took to facility planning, and the same approach we've seen work for facility owners across our coaching network.

<Info>

**Real Numbers, Real Lessons**: Brandon generously shared every detail of his facility journey—from his $70K total investment to his biggest mistake (rushing a flooring decision that cost him an extra $30-40K). His transparency, combined with insights from facility owners across our network, forms the foundation of this guide.

## Part 1: Competition Research (4 Weeks)

Before you even think about signing a lease or touring properties, you need to understand your competitive landscape. This isn't just about counting how many facilities exist—it's about finding the gap you can own. The coaches who succeed aren't necessarily in markets with less competition; they're in markets where they've identified what's missing and built that.

Brandon discovered this firsthand. Fort Wayne had 10-15 basketball training options, but after 20+ hours of research and 30 stakeholder conversations, he found his opening: nobody focused exclusively on skill development. Every competitor funneled athletes into AAU teams, performance packages, or membership upsells. That gap became Pro Standard Basketball Academy.

This 4-week research phase will save you from opening in an oversaturated market or—worse—opening a facility that offers the same thing everyone else does.

### Goal: Find the gap in your market you can own

Start by identifying every competitor, then analyze their positioning to discover what's missing. Don't copy what exists—find what doesn't exist and build that.

### Week 1-2: Comprehensive Competitor Identification

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Traditional Research" icon="magnifying-glass">

Google searches, Yelp, Facebook, Instagram, Parks & Rec, local leagues, and neighborhood drives

</Card>

<Card title="AI-Powered Research" icon="sparkles">

</Card>

</CardGroup>

**Traditional Online Research:**

- Google every keyword variation: "[sport] training," "AAU," "skill development," "camps," "academies," "lessons"
- Search Yelp, Facebook, Instagram (many skip professional websites)
- Contact Parks & Recreation for public programs
- Review local leagues and club organizations
- Drive target neighborhoods for "For Lease" signs on gyms

**Modern AI Acceleration:**

Prompt: "Find all [sport] training facilities, club programs, and performance centers in [city]. Include services, pricing, business models, and ownership structure."

Tools: Perplexity AI, Claude, Gemini

<Tip>

**Time Savings**: AI tools can compress 20+ hours of manual research into 2 hours of strategic searching. Use AI for initial discovery, then verify with direct research for accuracy.

</Tip>

**📸 PHOTO: AI search results screenshot** - "Using AI tools like Perplexity accelerates competitor research from 20 hours to 2 hours—here's a search for 'basketball training facilities in Fort Wayne'"  
*[Place after "Modern AI Acceleration" section]*

Brandon researched Fort Wayne's basketball market using Google searches, social media, and driving neighborhoods. He identified 10-15 competitors through 20+ hours of systematic research—research that could now be done in 2 hours with AI tools.

### Week 2-3: Build Your Intelligence Database

Create a spreadsheet tracking every competitor with these columns (if you can find them):

**Facility Analysis:**

- Name, location, square footage
- Condition, amenities, parking capacity

**Business Model:**

- Is training primary business or side offering?
- Single sport or multi-sport?
- Training structure: group only, private available, camps, leagues
- **Critical:** Do they funnel clients elsewhere? (AAU teams, performance packages, memberships)
- Ownership type: independent, hospital, franchise, nonprofit

**Pricing Structure:**

- Private sessions, group packages, memberships, drop-ins
- **Warning:** Don't copy competitor pricing blindly

<Warning>

**Pricing Trap to Avoid**: Some competitors intentionally lose money on training to drive revenue elsewhere (hospital referrals, gym memberships, AAU teams). As an independent facility, copying their artificially low prices means you can't cover your actual costs.

**Example**: Hospital-owned facility charging $40/session but making money when athletes need physical therapy. Independent facilities matching that $40 price can't cover real costs and fail within 18 months.

Use competitor pricing only to understand market baselines, not set your rates. We've seen this pricing trap sink multiple facilities in our coaching network—coaches who matched "loss leader" pricing without understanding the full business model behind it.

</Warning>

### Week 3-4: Human Intelligence (Most Valuable Research)

After mapping the competitive landscape online, it's time for the most valuable research you'll do: talking to real people. This is where you discover the gap between what facilities offer and what athletes actually want. Digital research tells you what exists; human conversations tell you what's missing.

**Target Conversations:**

- Local coaches: Email requesting informational meetings
- Parents: Talk at games, tournaments, recreation centers
- High school athletic staff
- League organizers
- Sporting goods employees

**Questions That Reveal Gaps:**

- "What programs has your child tried? What worked and didn't?"
- "What's missing in our area for [sport] development?"
- "How much do you invest annually in training?"
- "What would make you switch programs?"

Document everything. After 20-30 conversations, patterns emerge revealing unmet needs.

<Info>

**Brandon's Discovery**: After talking with 20-30 Fort Wayne basketball stakeholders, Brandon heard consistent feedback: crowded group sessions with no individual attention, every facility funneling kids into AAU teams or performance programs, nobody focused purely on skill development. This revealed his market gap and became the foundation for Pro Standard Basketball Academy's positioning.

**With your competitive landscape mapped and market gap identified, it's time to validate that opportunity with real revenue. The most critical mistake coaches make? Opening a facility before proving demand. Part 2 shows you how to de-risk your investment by building revenue first.**

---

## Part 2: Market Validation (2-3 Weeks Analysis + 3-12 Months Validation)

This is where dreams meet reality. You've found your market gap through research. Now you need to prove people will actually pay for what you're offering—before you commit to an expensive lease.

The traditional path is backwards: sign lease, build out facility, hope revenue materializes. The smart path? Build revenue in low-cost rented spaces, prove your model works, then open your facility backed by proven demand, not hope. Brandon trained in Fort Wayne church gyms for several years, saving nearly all his profit until his revenue hit double his projected facility costs. Only then did he begin his facility search. This approach eliminated 90% of his financial risk.

This validation phase might feel like it's delaying your dream. In reality, it's ensuring your dream doesn't become a nightmare 12 months after opening.

### The Smart Approach: Prove Demand Before Facility Commitment

**Recommended Path:**

1. Train in low-cost rented space (churches, community centers, hourly rentals)
2. Build clientele and test your value proposition
3. When revenue reaches **2x projected facility costs (important)**, start facility search
4. Open facility backed by proven demand, not hope

**Why This Works:**

- Dramatically reduces risk (expanding proven business vs. testing theory)
- Validates pricing in real market conditions
- Builds cash reserves for buildout
- Strengthens landlord negotiations (operating business vs. startup concept)
- Allows patient, selective facility search

**Low-Cost Validation Venues:**

**Brandon's Validation Journey**: Brandon trained in Fort Wayne church gyms for several years, building revenue to nearly double his estimated facility costs before beginning his facility search. He negotiated a deal with the church to pay $5/kid/hour—helping him short-term while providing the church consistent rental income long-term. This approach eliminated 90% of his financial risk and gave him $70K in saved capital to self-fund his facility.

### Essential Market Demographics

Understanding your market's demographics isn't optional—it's the foundation for knowing if enough potential customers exist to support your facility. You're looking for population density, income levels, and youth participation rates that signal sustainable demand.

**Research Requirements:**

- Total metro population (100K+ minimum recommended for specialized training)
- Youth population (ages 7-18 in your target range)
- Household income distribution (target $60K+ median)
- Youth sports participation rates

**Data Sources:**

*[Place after "Data Sources" section]*

### Geographic Analysis

Location isn't just about being "near" your target market—it's about accessibility, drive times, and geographic barriers that can make or break attendance patterns.

**Critical Questions:**

- Where do ideal clients live? (map target neighborhoods)
- Maximum acceptable drive time? (15-20 min for 80% recommended)
- Geographic barriers limiting access? (highways, rivers, railroad tracks)
- Neighborhood sports culture and commitment level?

**Location Strategy Considerations:**

- Proximity to affluent residential areas
- Access from multiple target neighborhoods
- Visibility vs. rent tradeoff
- Partnership opportunities (complementary businesses nearby)

**📸 PHOTO: Google Maps with competitor locations marked** - "Mapping Brandon's 10-15 competitors across Fort Wayne revealed downtown as the geographic center with equal access from all neighborhoods"

**📸 PHOTO: Google Maps drive time radius** - "15-minute drive time radius from downtown Fort Wayne covers 80% of target neighborhoods—the sweet spot for facility accessibility"  
*[Place after geographic analysis case study below]*

<Info>

**Brandon's Location Strategy**: Brandon chose downtown Fort Wayne despite wealthiest clients living in Southwest and North suburbs. Downtown provided equal access from all areas (avoiding tribal dynamics where families wouldn't cross town), lowest rent ($4/sq ft vs. $8-12/sq ft suburbs), and room to prove his model. He's now relocating to North Fort Wayne next to a sports performance center for cross-promotion in the wealthiest demographic—a strategic move only possible after proving his concept.

**You've validated demand and understand your market demographics. Now comes the sobering reality check: what does this actually cost? Part 3 breaks down every dollar of investment—from Brandon's $70K build-out to the monthly operating costs most coaches underestimate.**

---

## Part 3: Financial Reality (Real Numbers You Need)

This is where optimism meets spreadsheets. Most coaches underestimate facility costs by 30-50%, which creates cash flow crises within the first 6 months. This section gives you the complete financial picture—not the sanitized version you'll see in most business plan templates, but the real numbers from Brandon's $70K build-out and operating costs from facility owners across our network.

The goal isn't to scare you away from opening a facility. It's to ensure you open with eyes wide open, sufficient capital reserves, and realistic revenue projections. The coaches who fail aren't always the ones with the least money—they're the ones who underestimated what they'd need.

### Total Investment Range: $40K-$100K

This number can vary GREATLY depending on your size and buildout preferences.

**For 3,000-7,000 sq ft dedicated facility**

<CardGroup cols={3}>

<Card title="Conservative Build" icon="dollar-sign">

**$40-50K**

New equipment, professional contractors, modern tech

</Card>

<Card title="Premium Build" icon="dollar-sign">

**$80-100K**

High-end finishes, top equipment, full automation

</Card>

</CardGroup>

**Major Expense Categories:**

**Flooring: $8K-$50K (Largest Single Expense Typically)**

- Sport-specific court: $5-15/sq ft installed
- Communal areas: $2-5/sq ft
- Lead time: 6-10 weeks typical
- **Critical:** Get 3-5 quotes minimum, allow 3+ months
  - Look around on Facebook marketplace or used marketplaces

<Warning>

**Brandon's Expensive Lesson**: Get 3-5 quotes minimum and allow 3 months lead time. Brandon's mistake: One contractor, 2-week pressure, $40K spent on flooring worth $10K.

**How to avoid**: Start researching flooring the day you sign your lease. Get quotes from:

1. Commercial flooring companies
2. Used flooring marketplaces (Facebook, OfferUp)
3. Contractor referrals from your landlord
4. Neighboring facility recommendations
5. Online suppliers willing to ship

This single mistake cost Brandon $30-40K. We've seen this pattern repeatedly across our coaching network—rushing major purchases under time pressure always costs more.

</Warning>

**Facility Improvements: $5K-$15K**

- Specialized machines (if applicable: $3-15K)
- Sound system: $200-2K
- Storage solutions: $500-2K

<Tip>

**Cost Savings Opportunity**: Buy used equipment from closing facilities or upgrading competitors. Brandon estimates 40-60% savings on items like basketball hoops, wall padding, and training gear by shopping Facebook Marketplace and connecting with other facility owners.

</Tip>

**Technology: $2K-$5K**

- Scheduling/booking software
- Payment processing systems
- Security cameras: $500-3K
- WiFi infrastructure: $100-500
- Computer/tablets: $500-1.5K

<Info>

**Brandon's Investment**: Brandon's 4,700 sq ft Fort Wayne facility cost $70K total. $40-50K was flooring (his biggest mistake—rushed decision with one contractor). Should have been $8-10K with proper research and 3 months of shopping. Optimized investment for similar space: $50K.

</Info>

### Understanding Commercial Rent

If you've only rented apartments, commercial leases work differently. They're quoted annually per square foot, then you add "NNN" (triple net) charges for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Here's how to calculate your actual monthly cost.

**How It's Quoted:** Annual dollars per square foot

**Calculation Example:**

```
5,000 sq ft × $8/sq ft/year = $40,000 annual
$40,000 ÷ 12 months = $3,333/month base rent
```

**Plus NNN (Triple Net):** Three additional monthly charges

1. **Property taxes** (your proportional share)
2. **Building insurance** (property structure, not your liability)
3. **CAM** (Common Area Maintenance: parking, landscaping, exterior)

NNN typically adds $200-800/month depending on property.

<Tip>

**Real Monthly Cost Formula**: (Square Footage × $/sq ft ÷ 12) + NNN = Your actual monthly rent

Brandon's example: (4,700 sq ft × $4/sq ft ÷ 12) + $333 NNN = $1,900/month total

</Tip>

**Market Rate Ranges:**

| Location Type | Cost ($/sq ft) | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------------|---------------|------|------|----------|
| **Industrial Warehouse** | $4-8 | Lowest cost, high ceilings, large spaces | Less visibility, older facilities, limited amenities | Established coaches prioritizing margins |
| **Retail Strip Center** | $12-25 | High visibility, foot traffic, parking | Expensive, retail hours restrictions | High-end training, visibility-dependent |
| **Standalone Building** | $8-15 | Full control, flexible hours, signage | Medium cost, maintenance responsibility | Growing businesses ready to scale |
| **Shared Facility** | Varies | Lower commitment, built-in networking | Limited control, scheduling conflicts | Testing market, part-time operations |

<Info>

**Brandon's Rent Strategy**: Brandon secured $4/sq ft annually for 4,700 sq ft warehouse = $1,567/month base + $333/month NNN = $1,900 total occupancy cost. This was 50% below market due to old warehouse, no AC, industrial location, and motivated landlord. The money saved on rent ($1,500-2,000/month) gave him financial cushion to build his business—more valuable than a newer facility at market rates.

</Info>

### Monthly Operating Costs (Beyond Rent)

Once you're in the facility, rent is just the beginning. These ongoing expenses determine whether you're profitable or slowly bleeding cash. Most coaches underestimate operating costs by 20-30%, which creates the cash flow crises we see in months 4-6.

**Fixed Monthly Expenses:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Occupancy" icon="building">

**Rent + NNN**: Varies by space

Your largest fixed expense

- Marketing: $500-$3K (strategic investment)
- Equipment maintenance: $100-300
- Cleaning/toiletries: $100-200
- Professional services: $100-300

**Total Operating Range: $4K-$8K/month before owner compensation**

**Revenue Requirement:** Need $6K-$10K monthly to cover costs + modest salary + reserves

<Warning>

**CoachIQ Financial Tip**: Use CoachIQ's subscription products to create predictable monthly revenue. Recurring billing from membership packages helps you forecast cash flow more accurately and build those essential 6-12 month reserves.

</Warning>

### Insurance (Often Underestimated)

Insurance costs surprise most first-time facility owners—they budget for rent and utilities but forget comprehensive coverage can run $300-500/month. Don't skip this or underinsure to save money; one incident without proper coverage can end your business.

**Essential Coverage:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="General Liability" icon="shield">

**$1,500-3,000 annually**

Covers injuries, accidents on property

</Card>

<Card title="Professional Liability" icon="briefcase">

<Card title="Workers Comp" icon="user-injured">

**$2,000-5,000 annually**

</Card>

</CardGroup>

**Monthly Cost: $300-500 for comprehensive coverage**

<Note>

Get quotes from at least 3 insurance providers. Rates vary dramatically based on your sport, facility size, and state regulations. Some insurance companies specialize in sports facilities and offer better rates than general business insurers.

</Note>

### Unexpected Costs (Budget 20-30% Buffer)

No matter how detailed your projections, unexpected costs always appear. Budget an additional 20-30% beyond your estimates to cover surprises that inevitably arise during buildout and the first few months of operation.

- Professional painting runs higher than DIY estimates
- Small equipment replacement adds up monthly
- Toiletries and cleaning supplies ongoing
- Marketing that actually works requires investment
- All the "little things" collectively significant

### Financing Options

Most coaches don't have $40-100K in cash ready to deploy. Here are the financing paths we've seen work across our coaching network—from lowest risk to highest complexity.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Self-Funding" icon="wallet">

**Lowest Risk**

No debt service, full control. Limited by personal savings, takes longer to accumulate capital.

</Card>

<Card title="Revenue-First" icon="chart-line">

**Recommended**

Build revenue in rented space first. Open facility when revenue = 2x costs. Dramatically reduced risk.

</Card>

<Card title="SBA 7(a) Loan" icon="landmark">

**Traditional Financing**

Up to $5M, 10-25 year terms. Requires solid business plan, 650+ credit, 2-4 month approval.

- **Software**: $150/month (CoachIQ + minor tools)
- **Supplies**: $150/month
- **Marketing**: $500-1,000/month
- **Total operating**: ~$3,300-4,000/month

**Revenue Required**

- **Break-even**: $4,500/month (costs + minimal salary)
- **Comfortable**: $8,000/month (costs + $3-4K salary + reserves)
- **Thriving**: $15,000+/month (scaling phase)

Brandon hit break-even within 2 months of opening because he had proven demand first. His existing client base from church gyms transitioned to the facility immediately, eliminating the typical 3-6 month ramp-up period most new facilities face.

**Key Success Factors From Brandon's Journey:**

- **Saved $30-40K** by learning from his flooring mistake and not repeating it elsewhere
- **Self-funding** gave complete control with no debt stress during critical first year
- **Downtown location** at $4/sq ft provided 50% cost advantage over suburbs ($8-12/sq ft)
- **3-year lease** with renewal options = low risk test of the model
- **Old warehouse** with no AC was acceptable tradeoff for financial cushion—the $1,500-2,000/month he saved vs. nicer retail spaces gave him breathing room to build

### Rented Space vs. Dedicated Facility

Understanding when to stay in rented spaces versus committing to a facility is crucial. This comparison shows why the revenue-first approach (validating in rented spaces) reduces risk so dramatically—and why you shouldn't rush into a facility until the math clearly supports it.

| Factor | Rented Space (Churches, Schools) | Dedicated Facility |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Startup cost** | $500-2K | $40K-100K |
| **Monthly cost** | $600-1,200 | $3-8K |
| **Flexibility** | High (cancel anytime) | Low (3-5 year lease) |
| **Branding** | Limited | Complete control |
| **Schedule** | Restricted (evening/weekends) | Your hours |
| **Risk** | Very low | Medium-high |
| **Growth ceiling** | Low-medium | High |
| **Best for** | Validation phase | Scaling phase |

**You understand the financial reality. You have capital saved or financing secured. Now comes the longest part of the journey: finding the actual space. Part 4 covers the 8-12 month search process, from online platforms to broker relationships to the due diligence that separates great deals from money pits.**

---

## Part 4: The Facility Search (8-12 Months)

This is where patience becomes your competitive advantage. The coaches who rush this process—signing the first decent space they find—often regret it for the next 3-5 years. The coaches who methodically search, tour 10-20+ properties, and walk away from "almost right" deals? They end up in spaces that support their business instead of constraining it.

Brandon's facility search took 8 months. He toured numerous properties, walked away from several that seemed promising, and eventually found his downtown warehouse through a broker who reached out before public listing. That early access eliminated competition and simplified negotiations—advantages that came from having multiple brokers searching on his behalf while he remained patient.

This phase tests your discipline. You'll see spaces that are "good enough." You'll feel pressure to commit. Resist. The perfect space for your business exists, and finding it is worth the wait.

### Timeline: Don't Rush This Process

Expect 6-12 months from beginning search to signed lease. Bad location decisions haunt you for years through expensive leases with limited escape options. We've seen coaches sign 5-year leases on poorly researched spaces, then spend years wishing they'd waited another 2 months for a better option.

<Note>

**Brandon's Requirements**: Brandon needed 20+ ft ceilings for basketball shooting arcs and half-court space (47 ft × 50 ft minimum). He was willing to compromise on AC, aesthetics, and location visibility to hit his $4/sq ft rent target. Those compromises saved him $1,500-2,000/month compared to retail locations.

</Note>

### Due Diligence Questions

These aren't just polite conversation topics—these questions protect you from signing leases on properties with hidden problems. Ask every single one, and if you get evasive answers, consider it a red flag worth investigating further.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Building Condition Questions">

- Roof replacement date?
- HVAC age and condition?
- Electrical panel capacity?
- Flooding/water damage history?
- Structural issues?
- What's included in CAM?

<Accordion title="Lease Terms Questions">

- Base rent vs. NNN breakdown?
- Utilities separately metered?

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Operations Questions">

- Operating hours restrictions?
- Noise limitations?
- Parking arrangements?
- Security systems?
- WiFi infrastructure?

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>

**Document Everything**: Take notes during property tours, photograph issues, and follow up in email with any concerns. If a landlord promises something verbally (repairs, improvements, concessions), get it in writing before signing.

</Tip>

### Warning Signs (Walk Away)

These red flags indicate serious problems that typically cost more to fix than they're worth. We've seen facility owners ignore these warning signs and regret it for years afterward.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Environmental Issues" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid">

Strange odors (mold, sewage, chemicals), visible water damage or staining

</Card>

<Card title="Structural Concerns" icon="house-crack">

</Card>

</CardGroup>

<Warning>

**Trust Your Instincts**: If something feels off during property tours or negotiations, investigate further. Facility owners across our network report that their "gut feeling" about warning signs was correct 90%+ of the time. Don't talk yourself into a problematic space.

</Warning>

### Decision Framework

**Commit When:**

- Price fits budget (can afford 6 months rent at zero revenue)
- Location accessible to target demographic
- Space meets minimum requirements
- Landlord responsive and reasonable
- Lease terms match risk tolerance
- Gut feeling positive

**Walk Away When:**

- Math doesn't work (revenue can't support costs + salary)
- Difficult landlord during negotiation
- Major structural/system issues
- Wrong demographic location
- Better options available

<Check>

**Brandon's Decision**: Brandon committed to 4,700 sq ft warehouse despite being larger than wanted, old aesthetics, and no AC because:

1. $4/sq ft = 50% below market provided financial cushion
2. Downtown location gave equal access from all neighborhoods
3. 20 ft ceilings met basketball requirements
4. Responsive landlord who valued long-term tenant
5. 3-year lease with renewal options = low risk test

Imperfect space with perfect fundamentals. He prioritized financial sustainability over aesthetics—a decision that gave him breathing room to build his business.

**You've found your space. Now comes the negotiation that determines whether you thrive or struggle for the next 3-5 years. Part 5 covers lease negotiation strategies and the critical mistakes that cost coaches tens of thousands of dollars.**

---

## Part 5: Lease Negotiation & Critical Mistakes to Avoid

The lease negotiation is where most coaches leave $10K-50K on the table. They assume lease terms are fixed, they don't ask for concessions, they skip legal review, and they fail to negotiate exit strategies. Then they're locked into 5-year leases that become financial prisons when circumstances change.

Everything in a commercial lease is negotiable—from rent to tenant improvements to early termination clauses. Landlords expect negotiation. If you don't negotiate, you're literally the only person who didn't try. Brandon negotiated tenant improvement allowances, graduated rent increases, and renewal options that all came from simply asking.

This section covers negotiation leverage points we've seen work across our coaching network, plus the expensive mistakes that cost facility owners significant money and flexibility.

### Negotiation Leverage Points

**Everything Is Negotiable:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Rent Considerations" icon="dollar-sign">

First month free, graduated rent, annual increase caps, long-term concessions

</Card>

<Card title="Lease Terms" icon="file-signature">

Shorter initial terms, extension options, first refusal rights, sublease rights

</Card>

<Card title="Improvements" icon="hammer">

Tenant improvement allowance ($5-15K typical), maintenance clarity, modification permissions

</Card>

<Card title="Exit Strategy" icon="door-open">

Early termination clause, assignment rights if selling

</Card>

</CardGroup>

<Tip>

**Critical Principle**: Great landlord > saving $50-100/month rent. Responsive, fair landlords make operations dramatically easier than difficult ones. We've seen coaches endure years of maintenance delays, lease disputes, and operational headaches to save $75/month in rent—terrible trade-off.

</Tip>

### Financial Traps

<Warning>

**Overcommitting on Space**: Don't lease 10,000 sq ft hoping to "grow into it." Empty space costs money. Start with what you need, expand when demand justifies. We've seen coaches commit to large spaces "for future growth" then struggle to cover rent while 40% sits unused.

</Warning>

**Underestimating Costs**

Add 20-30% buffer to all projections. Assume higher costs, longer timelines, seasonal variations.

**Insufficient Reserves**

Maintain 6-12 months operating expenses in reserve. Don't spend every dollar on buildout.

<Warning>

**Skimping on Essentials**: Don't cheap out on flooring, insurance, marketing. These create bigger long-term problems. Brandon's flooring mistake ($30-40K extra from rushing) cost more than all his other "savings" combined.

</Warning>

**Ignoring Seasonality**

Budget for seasonal cost variations (heating/cooling) and revenue fluctuations.

### Operational Mistakes

**No Exit Strategy**

Get early termination clauses. Expensive but provides options if plans change.

<Warning>

**Verbal Agreements**: Everything negotiated must be written in lease. Verbal promises have zero legal weight. Brandon witnessed a facility owner lose $15K in promised tenant improvements because they relied on verbal confirmation instead of written lease terms.

</Warning>

**Rushing Decisions**

Time pressure leads to expensive mistakes. Be patient, even when frustrated.

**Wrong Location**

Beautiful facility in wrong neighborhood fails. Demographics and accessibility matter more than aesthetics.

<Info>

**Brandon's Biggest Mistake**: Rushing flooring procurement under time pressure, costing him $40K extra ($50K spent vs. $10K proper cost). His lesson: "Get 3-5 quotes and give yourself 3 months. Don't rush major purchases." This single mistake cost more than all his other buildout expenses combined.

## Frequently Asked Questions

These are the questions we hear most often from coaches planning their facility journey. The answers draw from Brandon's experience and patterns we've seen across our coaching network—real insights from real facility owners who've navigated this process.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Should I open a facility before I have clients, or build clients first?">

**Always build clients first.** Train in rented space (churches, community centers, schools) until your revenue reaches 2x your projected facility costs. This approach:

- Proves market demand before committing to expensive lease
- Builds cash reserves for buildout
- Strengthens landlord negotiations (operating business vs. startup)
- Reduces risk by 90%

Brandon trained in Fort Wayne church gyms for several years before opening his facility. This eliminated nearly all financial risk.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much money do I need to open a training facility?">

**Total investment range: $40K-$100K** for a 3,000-7,000 sq ft facility, including:

- Flooring: $8K-$50K (largest expense)
- Equipment: $5K-$15K
- Facility improvements: $5K-$15K
- Deposits: $5K-$15K (first month + security)
- Technology: $2K-$5K
- **Plus: 6-12 months operating expenses in reserve**

Brandon's 4,700 sq ft facility cost $70K total (though $40K was flooring—should have been $10K with proper research).

**Pro tip**: CoachIQ reduces your technology costs by $2-4K since you don't need separate scheduling, payments, website, and CRM tools.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the biggest mistake coaches make when opening a facility?">

**Three costly mistakes:**

1. **Not proving demand first** - Opening a facility hoping clients will come vs. expanding a proven business
2. **Rushing major purchases** - Brandon paid $40K for flooring that should have cost $10K because he rushed the decision
3. **Insufficient reserves** - Not maintaining 6-12 months operating expenses leads to cash flow crises

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does it take to find the right facility?">

**Expect 8-12 months** from beginning your search to signed lease.

**Timeline breakdown:**

- Month 1-2: Define requirements, engage brokers
- Month 3-8: Tour properties (10-20+), conduct due diligence
- Month 9-10: Negotiate lease terms
- Month 11-12: Legal review, sign lease, begin buildout

**Don't rush this.** Bad location decisions haunt you for years through expensive leases with limited escape options.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I buy or lease my training facility?">

**Lease first, buy later** for most coaches.

**Why lease:**

- Lower initial capital requirement ($5-10K deposit vs. $100K+ down payment)
- Flexibility to relocate if market shifts
- Landlord handles major repairs (roof, HVAC, structure)
- Can test location before committing to purchase
- Preserves capital for marketing and operations

**When to consider buying:**

- After 3-5 years of proven success in a leased space
- Strong cash position with 30-40% down payment available
- Planning 10+ year commitment to location
- Wanting to build real estate equity

Brandon leased for his first facility and is now considering purchase after proving the model.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if there's too much competition in my market?">

**Red flags indicating oversaturation:**

- 8-10+ quality facilities in your exact niche (not just general gyms)
- Destructive price wars with competitors undercutting each other
- Multiple facilities opened and closed in past 3 years
- Dominant player with 60%+ market share

**However, competition isn't always bad if:**

- You've identified a clear market gap through stakeholder conversations
- You offer something different (Brandon focused on pure skill development when everyone else funneled to AAU)
- Geographic opportunity exists (different part of city)
- You're targeting underserved demographic

Brandon found 10-15 basketball competitors in Fort Wayne but discovered none focused exclusively on skill development—that was his gap.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use CoachIQ before I have a facility?">

**Yes—and you should!**

CoachIQ is perfect for the "revenue-first approach":

- Accept bookings for sessions in rented spaces (churches, schools, community centers)
- Process payments and track exactly how much revenue you're generating
- Build a waitlist of athletes ready to join when you open your facility
- Create your professional website and branded app while searching for space
- Set up automation sequences that work immediately

When you finally open your facility, you'll have:

- Proven demand (revenue data)
- An existing client base
- A professional digital presence
- Systems already running

Many successful CoachIQ coaches started in rented spaces and transitioned to their own facilities once revenue justified it.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I can't afford $40K-$100K to open a facility?">

**Alternative paths:**

1. **Start even smaller**: Church gyms cost $30-75/hour. Train 10 hours/week = $150-300/week ($600-1,200/month). Build from there.

2. **Partnership model**: Find a facility owner who has empty court time. Propose revenue share or flat hourly rate.

3. **Incremental buildout**: Lease the space but build out gradually. Start with minimal flooring and equipment, expand as revenue grows.

4. **SBA Microloan**: Up to $50K with easier qualification than traditional loans.

5. **Equipment financing**: Finance 60-80% of major equipment purchases to preserve cash.

**Brandon's approach**: He saved training income for several years while working from church gyms, then self-funded his entire $70K investment. Zero debt gave him complete control but required patience.
