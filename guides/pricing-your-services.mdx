## The Bottom Line

Pricing is the most important decision in your business. Get it wrong, and you'll work twice as hard for half the money. Get it right, and everything else becomes easier.

## Start with an Onboarding Session

Before you think about your actual pricing, nail your onboarding session. This is the entry point for every new athlete—the one thing you market to people who don't know you yet.

### What is an onboarding session?

An onboarding session is a discounted first session (typically 60-80% off your normal rate) designed to get new families in the door. It's a no-brainer offer that removes the risk for parents who are on the fence.

<Tip>
**The principle**: One entry point, marketed consistently. Every new lead goes through the same door. This keeps your business clean, simple, and optimized.
</Tip>

### Why it works

Parents don't know you. They don't trust you yet. Asking them to commit to a training package before they've met you is a big ask. The onboarding session solves this by:

| Benefit | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Lowering the barrier** | It's cheap enough that there's no reason not to try |
| **Building trust** | They meet you, see your facility, and experience your coaching |
| **Collecting data** | You learn their goals, schedule, and what they care about |

<Frame>
  ![Trial session options on a coaching website](/images/pricing-trial-session-options.png)
</Frame>

### What happens during the session

The onboarding session serves two purposes: **data collection** and **trust building**.

You're not just running drills. You're listening:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand Their Goals">
    What does the parent want for their athlete? College recruitment? Making the team? Building confidence?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assess the Athlete">
    What are their strengths? Weaknesses? Current skill level? How do they respond to coaching?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learn Their Schedule">
    What sports do they play? When are they available? What's their commitment capacity?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match to a Package">
    By the end, you know exactly which package fits—and the sale becomes natural.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame caption="The checkout form collects key data: athlete name, age, parent contact, and more.">

**CoachIQ tip**: Our [Product Builder](/payments/product-builder) makes it easy to create a trial session product with custom intake forms. Collect athlete age, position, goals, and parent contact—all before they walk in the door.

## Commitment-Based Pricing Only

Here's the most important principle: **no one-off sessions**. Ever.

Your pricing must involve some form of commitment. This is non-negotiable if you want to build a sustainable business and actually help athletes improve.

<Info>
**Why this matters for athlete development**: You can't help someone get better if they show up randomly. Consistency is everything in sports training. Commitment-based pricing aligns your business model with what actually works.
</Info>

### Why commitment matters

| For Your Business | For the Athlete |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Predictable monthly revenue | Consistent training schedule |
| Reduced admin headaches | Real skill development |
| Better client relationships | Accountability to show up |
| Easier capacity planning | Measurable progress |

### Commitment structures that work

The most common commitment is **monthly**, but many facilities have great success with **3-month** or **6-month** commitments. The minimum should always be one month.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly">
    **Best for**: New facilities, testing pricing, flexible markets

    - Lowest barrier to entry
    - Easier to sell after onboarding
    - Higher churn risk
    - Most common starting point
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="3-Month">
    **Best for**: Established facilities, serious athletes

    - Better revenue predictability
    - Lower churn
    - Often offered at a small discount
    - Shows athlete commitment
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="6-Month / Annual">
    **Best for**: Premium positioning, loyal families

    - Best revenue predictability
    - Significant discount (10-15%)
    - Lowest churn
    - Builds long-term relationships
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Frame>
  ![Membership pricing tiers with commitment structure](/images/pricing-membership-tiers-example.png)
</Frame>

<Note>
**CoachIQ makes this easy**: Subscription management auto-charges cards on file, and the credit system automatically tracks each athlete's sessions, cancellations, and rescheduling—all visible in their app.
</Note>

<Frame caption="CoachIQ subscription management shows active subscriptions, monthly revenue, and status at a glance.">
  ![CoachIQ client subscription management view](/images/client-subscriptions.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
**Automate failed payment recovery**: CoachIQ automatically retries failed payments and sends reminder emails to parents. No more chasing down expired cards or awkward conversations about missed payments.
</Tip>

## Keep It Simple: Frequency-Based Packages

Parents are not experts. They don't understand—or care about—the nuanced difference between video analysis, skill work, strength training, and mental preparation. They just want their athlete to get better.

Your job is to make that happen. Their job is to choose how often to show up.

### The packages that work

Most successful facilities offer exactly four options:

| Package | Best For | Typical Price Range |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **2x per month** | Busy athletes juggling multiple sports | $80-120/month |
| **1x per week** | Standard commitment for consistent development | $160-240/month |
| **2x per week** | Serious athletes wanting accelerated progress | $280-400/month |
| **Unlimited** | High-volume athletes and dedicated families | $400-600/month |

That's it. The parent picks a frequency, commits monthly (or longer), and you handle the rest.

<Frame>
  ![Frequency-based training packages example](/images/pricing-frequency-packages-example.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
**How CoachIQ handles this**: Each package automatically assigns credits to the athlete's account. 1x/week = 4 credits/month. 2x/week = 8 credits/month. Athletes see their balance in the app and can book sessions until credits run out. No spreadsheets, no manual tracking.

Learn more: [Credit System Overview](/scheduling/credit-system-overview)
</Info>

### The pitch

After an onboarding session, the conversation sounds like this:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Close">
    *"I can definitely help your son reach his goals. Here's how we work—can you come in once a week or twice a week?"*

    Simple binary choice. Most parents pick one.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Busy Family">
    If they push back because of a busy schedule:

    *"What about just coming in twice a month for tune-ups? We can always adjust from there."*

    Gets them in the door. Upgrades happen naturally.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Serious Athlete">
    If the athlete is clearly committed:

    *"Based on what I saw today, twice a week would really accelerate his development. That's what most of our competitive players do."*

    Position the higher tier as the norm for serious athletes.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**The biggest mistake**: Too many offers.

Coaches constantly add more packages, more options, more complexity—thinking it gives parents "choice." It doesn't. It creates confusion, analysis paralysis, and operational nightmares for you.

Think about In-N-Out. They sell burgers. That discipline—that focus—is why they gross the most revenue per location in their industry. Your pricing should work the same way.
</Warning>

## Avoid One-on-One Sessions

This is a trap that destroys coaching businesses. Avoid it.

### Why one-on-one doesn't scale

| Factor | One-on-One | Small Group (4-10) |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Revenue per hour** | $60-100 | $240-600 |
| **Athlete development** | Good | Often better (competition, energy) |
| **Scalability** | Zero | High |
| **Parent expectations** | "I'm paying for all your attention" | "My athlete trains with peers" |

### Small groups are better for everyone

A small group of 4-10 athletes at similar skill levels is how you maximize development. Athletes feed off each other. You can run competitive drills and game-like scenarios. The energy is higher.

And for your business? You're making 4-10x more per hour than one-on-one would generate.

<Note>
If a parent insists on one-on-one training, that's a red flag. Protect your time and your business model. The right response: *"We've found athletes develop faster in our small group environment. That's how we structure all our training."*
</Note>

## Pricing to Your Market

There's no universal "right" price. Pricing depends on your location, your market, and the type of business you want to run.

### How to find your price

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Your Market">
    What are other facilities and coaches charging in your area? Call them. Check their websites. Get a baseline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide Your Positioning">
    Are you premium (higher price, fewer athletes, more personalized) or volume-based (more accessible, higher capacity)?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Factor in Your Costs">
    Rent, equipment, staff, insurance, and your own time. Make sure your pricing covers costs with healthy margins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Adjust">
    Start slightly higher than you think. It's easier to offer discounts than to raise prices on existing clients.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Typical ranges by market

| Market Type | Per-Session Range | Monthly (1x/week) |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Rural / Small town** | $30-45 | $120-180 |
| **Suburban** | $40-60 | $160-240 |
| **Affluent suburb** | $50-80 | $200-320 |
| **Urban / Metro** | $60-100 | $240-400 |

<Tip>
**Group size matters**: These ranges assume 4-10 athletes per session. Smaller groups (2-4) command higher prices. Larger groups (10+) should be priced lower per athlete but generate more total revenue.
</Tip>

## Add-Ons Follow the Same Rules

Once you've nailed your core offer, you can add supplementary services like video analysis, mental coaching, or specialized training. But the same principles apply.

### How to structure add-ons

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Subscription-Based" icon="rotate">
    Not one-off purchases. Monthly add-on to their existing package.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Optional" icon="circle-plus">
    They enhance your core offer, not replace it. Core training comes first.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple" icon="list-check">
    One or two add-ons maximum. Don't recreate the complexity problem.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Example**: A softball facility offers video analysis as an add-on. Athletes subscribe to the core training (1x/week at $200/month), and parents can add +$75/month for one video analysis session per month.

Total: $275/month for training + video analysis. Clean, simple, valuable.
</Info>

## Raising Prices

If you've been undercharging, raising prices is uncomfortable but necessary.

### The safest approach

**Grandfather existing clients** at their current rate and raise prices only for new clients. This protects your relationships with loyal customers—who are likely your best source of referrals.

### Timing matters

If your facility has a natural break—a holiday, off-season, or month you're closed—that's the ideal time to implement new pricing. It feels less abrupt and gives everyone a clean reset.

<Tip>
Your existing clients built your business. They refer new families and strengthen your reputation. Don't damage those relationships over a price increase. Let them keep their rate and raise prices on everyone new.
</Tip>

---

## Not Every Customer is a Good Customer

As you grow, you'll learn that some customers aren't worth the headache.

<Warning>
**Red flags to watch for:**

- Only wants one-on-one sessions (refuses group training)
- Constantly cancels or no-shows
- Doesn't respect your time or policies
- Pushes back on every aspect of how you run your business
- Wants to negotiate on everything
- Badmouths other coaches or facilities

Taking every customer when you're starting out makes sense. But as you grow, protecting your time and your business model matters more than filling every slot.
</Warning>
