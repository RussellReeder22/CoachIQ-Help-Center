## How Parents Actually Find Coaches

When a parent searches "basketball training near me" or "youth soccer coach Dallas," Google decides whether they find you or your competitor. Understanding this search journey helps you show up at the right moment.

### The Parent Search Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Phase">
    Parent realizes their child needs training. They search broad terms like "basketball training for kids" or "how to improve soccer skills." They're gathering information, not ready to book.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Comparison Phase">
    Parent searches with local intent: "basketball coach Austin" or "best youth soccer training near me." They're looking at Google Maps, reading reviews, comparing options.

    **This is where you win or lose.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decision Phase">
    Parent has narrowed to 2-3 options. They visit websites, check reviews one more time, and look for trust signals. Then they book.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Numbers That Matter

<Info>
**Why local SEO matters for coaches:**

- 46% of all Google searches have local intent
- 76% of people who search locally visit a business within 24 hours
- 98% of consumers read reviews before choosing a local business
- Google Business Profile listings drive 5x more calls than websites alone
</Info>

### The Three Pillars of Local Search

Your visibility comes from three sources working together:

| Pillar | What It Is | Your Action |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Business Listings** | Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Yelp | Claim and optimize |
| **Website Authority** | Your CoachIQ site's SEO foundation | Already handled for you |
| **Reviews & Reputation** | What parents say about you online | Actively build |

<Note>
**What CoachIQ handles for you**: Your website comes pre-optimized with professional SEO—fast hosting, mobile-first design, SSL security, clean URLs, and automatic sitemaps. You're starting ahead of coaches who built their own sites.

## Part 1: The Only Three Things That Actually Matter

If you have zero time, do these three things and stop. They drive 80% of your results.

### 1. Google Business Profile (Your Most Important Asset)

When parents search "basketball training near me," the first thing they see is the Google Map Pack—three local businesses with reviews, photos, and contact info. Your Google Business Profile determines whether you're in that pack or invisible.

<Frame>
  ![Google Maps showing local business results for sports training](/images/google-maps-local-pack-search-results.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
**The reality**: 86% of people look up business locations on Google Maps. Without a Google Business Profile, you're invisible to most potential clients.
</Info>

**Quick Setup Checklist:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Claim or Create Your Profile">
    Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com). Search for your business—if it exists, claim it. If not, create it.

    <Warning>
    Never create a duplicate listing. If you find an existing listing, always claim it rather than creating a new one.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the Right Category">
    Be specific. "Basketball coach" or "Soccer coach" ranks better than generic "Sports coaching."

    Your primary category directly affects which searches you appear in. Add secondary categories for additional visibility.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Every Field">
    - Exact business name (as it appears on your CoachIQ site)
    - Phone number
    - Website URL (your CoachIQ site)
    - Service area (all cities/zip codes you serve)
    - Hours of operation
    - Business description (750 characters—include your specialties, experience, and a call-to-action)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Photos">
    Listings with photos get 42% more direction requests.

    Upload at least 10 photos:
    - Professional headshot or logo
    - Action shots of you coaching
    - Your training space
    - Athletes in training (with permission)
    - Certifications displayed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Your Business">
    Google will verify via postcard, phone, or email. This takes 5-14 days. You can complete your profile while waiting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**The Weekly Habit (10 minutes):**

- Post something once a week (upcoming camp, training tip, athlete success)
- Respond to any new reviews within 48 hours
- Upload 1-2 new photos

<Tip>
**The secret weapon**: Most coaches set up Google Business Profile once and forget it. Post 2-3 times weekly and you'll outrank 90% of competitors within 90 days.
</Tip>

### 2. Reviews (Your 24/7 Sales Team)

Reviews do three things: they build trust before parents visit your website, they directly influence your Google ranking, and they provide social proof that converts browsers into bookers.

<Info>
**The math**: A business with 50 reviews averaging 4.5 stars will almost always outrank a business with 5 reviews averaging 5 stars. Volume matters.
</Info>

**When to Ask for Reviews:**

The best time to ask is right after a breakthrough moment:
- First successful game after training
- Personal record achieved
- Skill milestone reached
- End of a successful camp

Parents are most motivated to share when emotions are high.

**How to Ask:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="In Person">
    After a great session: "I'm so glad [athlete] is making progress! If you have a minute, a Google review would really help other families find us."
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Automated">
    Set up a CoachIQ automation that sends a message 24 hours after session completion:

    "Hi [Parent Name]! Thanks for trusting me with [Athlete's] development. If you're happy with our progress, I'd really appreciate a quick Google review: [your review link]. Your feedback helps other families find quality training!"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Get Your Direct Review Link:**

1. Go to your Google Business Profile dashboard
2. Click "Get more reviews"
3. Copy your short URL
4. Use this link in all review requests

**Responding to Reviews:**

Respond to ALL reviews within 48 hours. This shows you're engaged and encourages more reviews.

| Review Type | Response Approach |
|-------------|------------------|
| **5-star** | Thank them specifically, mention the athlete's progress |
| **3-4 star** | Thank them, acknowledge the feedback, offer to discuss how to improve |
| **1-2 star** | Stay professional, apologize for the experience, offer to make it right offline |

<Note>
**Set up automated review requests**: CoachIQ automations can trigger review requests after sessions complete.

Learn more: [Automations Overview](/automations/overview)
</Note>

---

### 3. NAP Consistency (The Foundation)

NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone number. When your business information is identical everywhere online, Google trusts you more and ranks you higher. When it's inconsistent, Google gets confused.

**The One-Hour Fix:**

Make sure these five listings have identical information:

1. **Google Business Profile** (most important)
2. **Apple Maps** ([register.apple.com/business](https://register.apple.com/business))
3. **Your CoachIQ website**
4. **Facebook Business Page**
5. **Yelp** ([biz.yelp.com](https://biz.yelp.com))

<Warning>
**Common mistakes that hurt you:**

- "Elite Basketball Training" on Google, "Elite Basketball Training LLC" on Facebook
- Different phone numbers on different platforms
- Old address that was never updated
- Inconsistent hours of operation
</Warning>

**Your Source of Truth:**

Use your CoachIQ website as the master record. When filling out any listing, copy directly from your site to ensure consistency.

## Part 2: If You Have More Time (The Accelerators)

These tactics compound over time. They're not urgent, but they separate coaches who dominate local search from those who just show up.

### Create Separate Service Pages

Instead of one "Services" page listing everything, create individual pages for each offering:

- `/private-training` — "Private Basketball Training Austin"
- `/group-training` — "Small Group Basketball Sessions Austin"
- `/summer-camps` — "Summer Basketball Camps Austin 2026"
- `/team-training` — "Team Basketball Training Austin"

Each page can rank for different keywords. A parent searching "basketball camps Austin" finds your camp page directly.

<Tip>
**CoachIQ makes this easy**: Create separate pages in your Website Builder, each with its own title, description, and keywords.

Learn more: [Meta Titles & Keywords](/website/seo-marketing/meta-titles-descriptions)
</Tip>

<Frame>
  ![CoachIQ page SEO settings panel](/images/website-page-seo-settings.png)
</Frame>

---

### Local Content That Gets Indexed

Here's an insight most coaches miss: **any content that mentions your local area gets indexed for local searches.**

This applies to:
- Blog posts
- YouTube video titles and descriptions
- Video transcripts (YouTube auto-generates these)
- Instagram captions
- Facebook posts

**Example:**

A YouTube video titled "3 Basketball Shooting Drills" helps nobody find you.

A YouTube video titled "3 Basketball Shooting Drills for Dallas Youth Players" ranks for "Dallas basketball training" and related searches.

**The formula:**

> [Helpful Content] + [Your City/Area] = Local SEO Value

**Content Ideas That Work:**

| Content Type | Example | Why It Works |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| Tournament prep | "How to Prepare for the Austin Youth Basketball League Tryouts" | Parents search this |
| Seasonal guides | "Summer Training Schedule for North Dallas Athletes" | Timely + local |
| Local tips | "Best Parks for Soccer Practice in Cedar Park" | Useful + ranks locally |
| Event recaps | "Highlights from Our Spring Break Basketball Camp in Plano" | Shows activity + local |

<Note>
**You're not "doing SEO"—you're making content that naturally includes local context.** The video transcript gets indexed. The blog post gets indexed. Your Instagram caption gets indexed.
</Note>

<Frame>

### Encourage User-Generated Content

92% of consumers trust organic user-generated content more than traditional advertising. When athletes and parents post about training, you get:

- Free content you didn't create
- Social proof that builds trust
- Location tags that help discoverability

**How to encourage it:**

- Create an Instagram-worthy moment at your facility (logo wall, achievement board)
- Ask athletes to tag your location when posting training clips
- Repost their content (with permission) to your own channels
- Run a monthly "tag us to win" contest

---

### Expand Your Listings (When You Have Time)

Beyond the essential five, these listings add incremental value:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bing Places for Business">
    Powers Bing, Yahoo, Alexa, and Cortana. Popular with older demographics.

    **Shortcut**: Import directly from Google Business Profile at [bingplaces.com](https://www.bingplaces.com)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Nextdoor Business">
    Hyperlocal platform where neighbors recommend services. Great for "looking for a coach" posts.

    Create at [nextdoor.com](https://nextdoor.com) → Business section
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local Directories">
    - Chamber of Commerce ($200-500/year, adds credibility)
    - City Parks & Recreation "approved vendors" list
    - Local parenting magazines/websites
    - Youth league websites
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instagram Location">

### Sampling Events for SEO + Leads

Camps, skills clinics, and "Bring a Friend Day" events serve double duty:

1. **Generate leads directly** — New families experience your coaching
2. **Create content opportunities** — Photos, testimonials, local coverage
3. **Give you something to post** — Fresh content for Google Business Profile

<Tip>
**Pre-season timing**: Parents start searching for training 6-8 weeks before each sports season. Plan your events and content accordingly.
</Tip>

---

## Part 3: For the Ambitious (Advanced Tactics)

These tactics require more effort but can significantly accelerate growth when you're ready to scale.

### Building Local Authority Through Backlinks

When other websites link to yours, Google sees it as a vote of confidence. Local backlinks are especially valuable for local search rankings.

**Partnership Opportunities:**

| Partner Type | What to Ask For |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Local sports stores | "Recommended Trainers" page on their website |
| Physical therapists | Cross-referral listing |
| Schools | Link from athletic department resources |
| Youth leagues | Partner/vendor page |
| Local news | Coverage of your camps or athlete achievements |

**How to approach:**

> "Hi [Name], I provide professional [sport] training for youth athletes in [area]. Many of your [customers/players/patients] already train with me. Would you be open to adding my business to your recommended resources? Happy to do the same for you."

**Event Sponsorship:**

Sponsor local charity runs, tournaments, or school events. Organizers typically link to sponsors from their official pages.

---

### Google Search Console

Google Search Console shows you exactly how Google sees your site—what searches you appear in, your average position, and any technical issues.

**Monthly check-in (5 minutes):**

1. Go to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Check Performance → See which searches bring traffic
3. Check Coverage → Fix any errors Google found

For setup instructions: [Google Search Console Setup](/website/seo-marketing/seo-google-search-console)

### Local Partnerships That Generate Ongoing Value

The best partnerships create ongoing SEO value, not just one-time links:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Complementary Businesses" icon="handshake">
    Physical therapists, nutritionists, sports psychologists, equipment stores

    Cross-promote each other's services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schools & Leagues" icon="school">
    Offer to run clinics, provide training resources

    Get listed as official training partner
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Media" icon="newspaper">
    Pitch stories about athlete achievements, camp milestones

    Local news loves youth sports stories
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community Events" icon="calendar">
    Sponsor, participate, volunteer

    Shows up in event coverage and builds reputation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Part 4: The Long Game (Expectations & Timeline)

SEO is not instant. Setting realistic expectations helps you stay consistent instead of giving up too early.

### Realistic Timelines

| Tactic | When You'll See Results |
|--------|------------------------|
| Google Business Profile optimization | 2-4 weeks |
| Reviews (10+ new reviews) | Immediate ranking boost |
| NAP consistency fixes | 2-4 weeks |
| Website content/blog posts | 3-6 months |
| Local backlinks | 3-6 months |
| Comprehensive content strategy | 6-12 months |

<Note>
**Google Business Profile delivers fastest results.** If you only have time for one thing, this is it. Organic website ranking takes longer but compounds over time.
</Note>

### What to Measure

**Monthly:**
- Google Business Profile Insights (views, clicks, calls, direction requests)
- New reviews received
- "How did you hear about us?" responses on intake forms

**Quarterly:**
- Google Search Console (which searches bring traffic)
- Overall inquiry volume compared to previous quarter

**Don't obsess over:**
- Daily ranking changes (they fluctuate naturally)
- Vanity metrics (website visits without conversions)
- Competitor rankings (focus on your own growth)

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long until I show up in Google?">
    Google Business Profile: 2-4 weeks after verification. Website organic rankings: 3-6 months of consistent effort. Google Business Profile results appear much faster than organic—prioritize it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a blog for SEO?">
    A blog helps if you'll consistently publish local, relevant content. Writing about local tournaments, training tips for area schools, and seasonal programs boosts rankings. Random or infrequent posts won't help. Don't start a blog unless you'll post at least monthly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's more important—website SEO or Google Business Profile?">
    Google Business Profile drives more immediate local traffic. Website SEO provides long-term authority. Do both, but prioritize GMB if you must choose. Fortunately, CoachIQ handles website SEO, so you can focus on GMB.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I pay for Google Ads?">
    GMB is free and should be optimized first. Once you're getting consistent organic results, Google Ads can amplify your reach—especially for competitive keywords or seasonal camps. Start organic, add paid when you're ready to scale.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I compete with established coaches who have more reviews?">
    Focus on what you can control: post more frequently (2-3x/week on GMB), respond to every review, upload fresh photos weekly, and keep NAP consistent. Newer businesses can outrank established ones with better optimization and activity signals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do social media posts help SEO?">
    Not directly—social media posts don't improve Google rankings. But they help indirectly: content that mentions your local area gets indexed, social profiles appear in search results, and social activity drives website traffic. Don't do social media for SEO—do it for awareness and engagement.
  </Accordion>
