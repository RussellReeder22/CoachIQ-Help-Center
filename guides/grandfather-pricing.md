# Grandfathering Existing Clients: Price Increase Strategy Guide

**How to raise prices for new clients while honoring existing client rates in CoachIQ**

---

## Overview

Raising your prices is a natural part of business growth, but you want to reward loyal clients who've been with you from the start. CoachIQ gives you the flexibility to increase rates for new clients while automatically maintaining existing clients at their current pricing—a strategy known as "grandfathering."

This guide walks you through the complete process of implementing a price increase that protects your existing client relationships while positioning your business for sustainable growth.

<Info>
  **Business impact**: Coaches who implement strategic price increases see an average 20-30% revenue boost within 6 months while maintaining 95%+ client retention through grandfathering.
</Info>

## Why grandfather existing clients?

Grandfathering demonstrates loyalty and builds long-term relationships. Your existing clients:

- Took a chance on you when you were building your reputation
- Provide testimonials and referrals
- Create predictable recurring revenue
- Cost less to retain than new clients to acquire

Meanwhile, new pricing reflects your increased experience, improved services, and current market value.

## Your grandfathering strategy: Choose your situation

The right approach depends on where you are in your CoachIQ journey:

## Strategy 1: New to CoachIQ (Migration scenario)

**Your situation**: You're switching to CoachIQ from another platform, spreadsheets, or manual processes. You have existing clients paying at your old rates, and you want to use this transition to implement new pricing for future clients.

### How it works

You'll create **two separate product sets** in CoachIQ:

1. **Legacy products** - For existing clients only, not visible on your public website
2. **New products** - For future clients, displayed on your website and athlete portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan your product structure">
    Before creating anything in CoachIQ, map out your offerings:

    **Legacy products** (for existing clients):

    - List each service/membership you currently offer
    - Note the current price each existing client pays
    - Determine if any clients have custom rates

    **New products** (for future clients):

    - List the same services with your new pricing
    - Decide on your new rate structure

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Create a simple spreadsheet with columns for "Service Name," "Legacy Price," "New Price," and "Existing Clients on This." This becomes your reference guide during setup.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your legacy products first">
    Start by setting up products for your existing clients:

    1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Products**
    2. Click **Create Product** (or your new product button)
    3. Name it clearly to distinguish it as legacy:
       - Example: "Monthly Training (Legacy - \$199)"
       - Example: "Group Sessions - Existing Clients"
    4. Set the price to your **current/old rate**
    5. Configure all other settings (billing frequency, description, etc.)
    6. **Important**: Do NOT add this product to your website or athlete portal
    7. Save the product

    Repeat this process for each service you offer at your current pricing.

    <Note>
      **Naming convention**: Include "(Legacy)" or the price in the product name so you can easily identify it in your admin panel. Clients will see a cleaner name on their invoices if you customize the client-facing display name separately.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your new public-facing products">
    Now set up products at your new pricing:

    1. Navigate to **Payments → Products**
    2. Click **Create +**
    3. Name it with your public-facing name:
       - Example: "Monthly Training"
       - Example: "Group Sessions"
    4. Set the price to your **new rate**
    5. Configure all settings identically to the legacy version
    7. Save the product
    6. Display this product on your website and athlete portal

    These are the products new clients will see and purchase from your public pages.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send legacy products to existing clients">
    Now you need to get your existing clients signed up for their legacy products:

    1. Copy the direct link or checkout page for the legacy product
    2. Send personalized emails to existing clients with their specific signup link
    3. Include clear instructions and the price they'll be paying
    4. Follow up with clients who don't complete signup

    <Warning>
      **Critical**: Do not share legacy product links publicly or on your website. Only send them directly to existing clients who should receive that pricing.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your setup">
    Confirm everything is configured correctly:

    **For legacy products**:

    - Created with old pricing
    - Named clearly for internal identification
    - NOT visible on website or athlete portal
    - Assigned to existing clients only

    **For new products**:

    - Created with new pricing
    - Public-facing professional names
    - Visible on website and athlete portal
    - Ready for new client purchases

    <Check>
      **Success!** New clients see and purchase at new rates, while existing clients are protected at their legacy pricing.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing your dual product structure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if an existing client wants to change their service level?">
    This requires a business decision:

    **Scenario**: Client on "Monthly Training (Legacy - \$199)" wants to upgrade to "Weekly Training"

    **Options**:

    1. **Maintain loyalty**: Create a legacy version of the new service at a proportional old rate
    2. **New pricing applies**: Client moves to the new public product at current rates
    3. **Hybrid approach**: Offer a discounted rate between legacy and new pricing

    Document your policy and communicate it clearly when clients inquire about changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I prevent existing clients from accidentally seeing new pricing?">
    **Best practices**:

    - Never mention specific new pricing in group communications
    - When discussing services with existing clients, reference "your current rate"
    - If clients browse your public website, they'll see new pricing—be prepared to explain your loyalty pricing structure
    - Consider adding an FAQ to your website: "Current clients: Your rate remains unchanged. Contact me for your pricing."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if a legacy client cancels?">
    Decide this policy before migration and include it in your communications:

    **Option 1 - Grace period**: "If you cancel and return within 30 days, your rate is protected"

    **Option 2 - Permanent protection**: "Your legacy rate is yours for life, even if you pause and restart"

    **Option 3 - One-time protection**: "If you cancel, new pricing applies to any future rejoining"

    In CoachIQ, you can:

    - Keep their client profile with notes about their legacy status
    - Reassign them to their legacy product if they return (Option 1 or 2)
    - Assign them to new products if your policy is Option 3
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I create legacy products for every price variation?">
    Only if you have multiple existing clients at that rate:

    **Create separate legacy products when**:

    - 3+ clients paying the same rate
    - Significantly different price points
    - Different service levels or frequencies

    **Use client notes for exceptions**:

    - 1-2 clients with unique pricing
    - Custom negotiated rates
    - Temporary promotional rates

    Add detailed notes to these clients' profiles about their special pricing and manually adjust invoices if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Strategy 2: Active on CoachIQ (Price increase scenario)

**Your situation**: You've been using CoachIQ and have active client subscriptions running through Stripe. You want to raise your prices for new clients, but existing subscriptions should remain at their current rates automatically.

### How it works

When you update your product pricing in CoachIQ, **existing active subscriptions in Stripe automatically maintain their current rates**. Only new subscriptions will use the updated pricing.

<Info>
  **Good news**: CoachIQ's integration with Stripe handles grandfathering automatically for active subscriptions. You don't need to create duplicate products or manually manage existing clients.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your current products and subscriptions">
    Before making changes, understand your current state:

    1. Navigate to **Payments → Products**
    2. Note which products have active subscribers
    3. For each product, review:
       - Current pricing
       - Number of active subscriptions
       - Billing frequency

    <Tip>
      **Documentation tip**: Take screenshots of your current pricing structure. This helps you reference the legacy rates and communicate with clients who have questions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your product pricing">
    Simply change the price on your existing products:

    1. Go to **Payments → Products**
    2. Select the product you want to update
    3. Navigate to the **Pricing** section
    4. Enter your new price
    5. Click **Save Changes**

    That's it! Any new customer will be pay your new rate while your existing customers are locked in to the previous rate.

    <Note>
      **What happens behind the scenes**: CoachIQ updates the product price for new purchases, but Stripe maintains existing subscription rates unchanged. Your existing clients continue paying their original rate automatically.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify existing subscriptions remain unchanged">
    Confirm that active clients weren't affected:

    1. Go to **Dashboard → Clients**
    2. Select a few existing clients with active subscriptions
    3. View their subscription details
    4. Confirm their billing amount shows the old rate

    You can also check Stripe directly:

    1. Log into your Stripe dashboard
    2. Navigate to **Subscriptions**
    3. Review a few existing subscriptions
    4. Verify the price hasn't changed

    <Check>
      **Success!** Your new product pricing is live for new clients, while existing subscriptions continue at their original rates.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your website and marketing">
    Make sure new clients see your updated pricing:

    1. Review your website to ensure it reflects new pricing
    2. Update any marketing materials or rate sheets
    3. Brief team members on the new pricing structure
    4. Prepare talking points for sales conversations
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important considerations for active subscriptions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if a client cancels and wants to resubscribe?">
    When a client cancels their subscription, they lose their legacy pricing protection. If they want to rejoin:

    **By default**: They'll need to subscribe at your new current pricing

    **To offer legacy pricing**: You'll need to manually process their subscription at the old rate through Stripe or create a custom payment arrangement

    **Best practice**: Establish and communicate a clear policy:

    - "If you cancel and return within 30 days, contact me to discuss rate options"
    - "Once cancelled, new pricing applies to future subscriptions"
    - "Pausing is available instead of cancelling to maintain your rate"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I update the price for existing subscriptions if I want to?">
    Yes, but it requires intentional action in Stripe. Automatic grandfathering is the default, but you can manually update subscription prices when needed:

    **To update individual subscriptions**:

    1. Access the subscription in Stripe
    2. Update the price for that specific subscription
    3. Set when the new price takes effect (immediately or next billing cycle)

    **Common reasons to update**:

    - Expiration of grandfather period (with 60-90 day notice to clients)
    - Service level changes requested by client
    - Agreement with client to transition to new pricing

    <Warning>
      **Always communicate first**: Never update a subscription price without advance written notice to the client (typically 60-90 days).
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about clients who upgrade or downgrade?">
    When a client changes their service level, they're technically creating a new subscription:

    **Upgrading**:

    - Client cancels current subscription
    - Creates new subscription at the upgraded service level
    - New subscription uses your current pricing

    **Maintaining loyalty on upgrades**: If you want to honor their legacy pricing on the upgrade:

    1. Manually process the upgrade through Stripe
    2. Set a custom price based on their legacy rate ratio
    3. Document the special pricing in the client's notes

    **Example**: Client paying $200 for Service A (when current price is $250) wants to upgrade to Service B (currently $300). Loyalty pricing: $240 (same 20% legacy discount).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I track which clients have legacy pricing?">
    Several tracking methods:

    **Method 1 - Client tags**:

    1. Add a tag like "Legacy Pricing" or "Pre-2025 Rate" to grandfathered clients
    2. Use this tag to filter and view all legacy-rate clients

    **Method 2 - Client notes**:

    - Add a note to each client's profile: "Legacy rate: \$X, started [date]"
    - Include any special terms or expiration dates

    **Method 3 - Stripe metadata**:

    - Add custom metadata to subscriptions in Stripe
    - Mark legacy subscriptions for easy identification

    **Method 4 - Spreadsheet tracking**:

    - Export client list with subscription details
    - Track legacy vs. new pricing in a master spreadsheet
    - Update monthly to monitor the transition
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I change products entirely?">
    If you're restructuring your offerings significantly (new product names, different service bundles), you're essentially in the "New to CoachIQ" scenario even though you're an existing user.

    In this case:

    1. Create your new product structure at new pricing
    2. Keep your old products for existing subscriptions
    3. Stop displaying old products publicly
    4. Gradually transition clients to new products as their subscriptions renew or they choose to upgrade

    This gives you a clean break while still maintaining existing commitments.
  </Accordion>

## Communicating your price increase

How you communicate the change is just as important as the pricing strategy itself. Here's a proven approach:

### Announcement timeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="60-90 days before: Initial announcement">
    Send a personal message through CoachIQ Inbox:

    **Subject**: Important update about [Your Business Name]

    **Key points**:

    - Announce the upcoming price increase
    - Explain the reason (expanded services, increased experience, market alignment)
    - **Clearly state existing clients are grandfathered**
    - Provide the exact date new pricing takes effect
    - Express gratitude for their loyalty

    <Tip>
      **Messaging template**: "As a valued client who's been with me since [timeframe], your current rate of [amount] will remain unchanged. This is my way of saying thank you for your trust and support. New clients joining after [date] will invest [new amount]."
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="30 days before: Reminder and FAQ">
    Follow up with:

    - Reminder of the upcoming change
    - Answers to common questions
    - Emphasis that their rate remains unchanged
    - Details on what new clients will pay
    - Explanation of what happens if they pause/cancel

    This reinforces their special status and reduces confusion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="1 week before: Final notice">
    Send a brief reminder:

    - New pricing takes effect in one week
    - Their rate is still protected (if applicable)
    - New client pricing listed for their reference
    - Encourage referrals before the rate change
  </Step>
  <Step title="On effective date: Confirmation">
    After implementation:

    - Confirm the change is live
    - Thank existing clients again
    - Update your website and marketing materials
    - Brief team members on how to discuss pricing
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Message tone and positioning

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="DO say" icon="check">
    - "Your loyalty matters to me"
    - "Your current rate remains unchanged"
    - "This helps me continue providing excellent service"
    - "New clients will invest [new amount]"
  </Card>
  <Card title="DON'T say" icon="xmark">
    - "I have no choice but to raise prices"
    - "Costs are going up everywhere"
    - "You're getting a special deal"
    - "I'm sorry for the inconvenience"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Using CoachIQ's communication tools

Send your announcement efficiently:

1. **Dashboard → Inbox → New Message**
2. Select clients you want to message
3. Craft your message using the template above
4. Schedule for optimal send time

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Follow up individually with your highest-value clients. A personal phone call or video message shows extra appreciation for their business.
</Tip>

## Business considerations and FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much should I increase my prices?">
    Industry benchmarks suggest:

    - **10-15%**: Standard annual increase for inflation and experience
    - **20-30%**: Significant service improvements or market repositioning
    - **30%+**: Major business transformation or premium positioning

    Test the market by:

    - Researching competitor pricing in your area
    - Surveying new client willingness to pay
    - Calculating your true cost of service delivery
    - Considering your experience and results
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if an existing client refers someone?">
    Create a clear referral policy:

    **Option 1 - Standard rate**: Referrals pay new pricing (most common)

    **Option 2 - Referral discount**: Offer referred clients a discount (10-20% off new rate) for a limited time

    **Option 3 - Legacy rate extension**: Allow referrals from grandfathered clients to access legacy pricing (typically for first month only)

    Document your choice and communicate it when announcing the price increase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I eventually move everyone to new pricing?">
    Consider transitioning all clients when:

    - It's been 18-24 months since the increase
    - Your service offering has significantly changed
    - The price gap becomes too large (40%+ difference)
    - You're ready for another strategic increase

    Always provide 60-90 days notice and consider offering legacy clients something special (bonus sessions, free month) to ease the transition.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle clients on payment plans?">
    For clients with existing payment plans:

    1. **Honor the current plan**: Let them finish at the agreed rate
    2. **Document in their profile**: Note when the plan ends
    3. **Set a reminder**: Schedule follow-up for plan completion
    4. **Offer renewal options**: When plan ends, offer new pricing with option to renew at a middle-tier rate as a loyalty bonus

    **In CoachIQ**:

    - View payment plans under **Dashboard → Payments**
    - Add notes to each client's profile about grandfathered status
    - Client's scheduled payments will continue at agreed amounts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about family or group discounts?">
    Maintain the discount structure, not the absolute price:

    **Example**:

    - Old pricing: $200/month, siblings get 20% off ($160)
    - New pricing: $250/month, siblings still get 20% off ($200)

    The discount percentage stays the same, but applies to your current rate structure. Grandfathered clients keep both their base rate AND their discount structure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I prevent accidentally charging legacy clients new rates?">
    Set up safeguards:

    1. **Tag legacy clients** in CoachIQ with "Grandfathered" tag
    2. **Add detailed notes** to client profiles about their rate and start date
    3. **Create a reference spreadsheet** of all legacy pricing
    4. **Review before any subscription changes** involving legacy clients
    5. **Train team members** if you have staff on the pricing structure

    **For Strategy 2 (Active on CoachIQ)**: The system automatically maintains existing subscription rates, so accidental overcharging is unlikely unless you manually change subscription prices in Stripe.

    If an error occurs, immediately refund the difference and apologize with a bonus session or credit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I tell new clients about grandfathered pricing?">
    **Generally no**. This can create several issues:

    - New clients may feel they're overpaying
    - Creates pressure to negotiate rates
    - Diminishes perceived value of your services

    Exception: If directly asked, be honest but frame it positively: "I reward long-term client loyalty with rate protection. Clients who've been with me for [timeframe] have locked-in rates as a thank you for their early support."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced grandfathering strategies

### Progressive price increases

Instead of one large jump, implement gradual increases:

**Year 1**: Grandfather existing clients, new clients at +15%\
**Year 2**: Previous "new clients" grandfathered, newest clients at +15%\
**Year 3**: All clients moved to unified rate with 90-day notice

This creates multiple price tiers that gradually converge over time.

### Grandfather expiration with benefits

Set a 12-18 month grandfather period with this promise:

"Your rate is protected for the next 18 months. When pricing adjusts, you'll receive:

- 60-day advance notice
- A free month of service
- Priority booking privileges
- First access to new programs"

This gives clients long-term security with a known eventual transition.

### Value-add instead of price freeze

Rather than maintaining old rates indefinitely, offer enhanced value:

"Your monthly rate increases to [new amount], but you now receive:

- Extra session per month
- Access to group training
- Priority scheduling
- Monthly video programming"

This lets you standardize pricing while still honoring loyal clients with increased value.
