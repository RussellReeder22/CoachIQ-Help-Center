## Automations: Major Upgrade

We shipped a significant update to [Automations](/automations/what-are-automations) this month, giving you more power to automate your business workflows.

### New Features

**Session Notes & Custom Fields in Automations**

You can now include session notes and athlete [custom fields](/people/adding-editing-clients#adding-custom-fields) (like skill level, position, or training focus) in your automated messages. Perfect for sending personalized session reminders with context about each athlete.

**Booking Notes**

Add notes to individual sessions or entire recurring booking series. Great for tracking athlete-specific information, session goals, or occurrence-specific details. Notes are visible from your [calendar](/scheduling/calendar-overview-and-navigation) and can be used in automations.

**Wait/Delay Actions**

Create timed sequences in your automations. For example: send a welcome email immediately, then follow up with a training tips message 3 days later. [See all available actions →](/automations/triggers-actions-reference#all-actions)

**Scheduled Check Trigger**

Run automations on a recurring schedule (daily, weekly, etc.) to check conditions across your athlete base. Use this to automatically tag athletes based on subscription status, send weekly check-ins, or manage credits. [Learn more about scheduled automations →](/automations/scheduled-automations)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with email, SMS, and in-app message actions not sending correctly
- Resolved errors when adding tags to users via automation
- Fixed announcement sending errors
- Wait/delay duration can now be adjusted properly
- Trash icon now works correctly under wait/delay conditions
- Product list UI no longer overlaps in automation builder
- Scheduled check trigger now saves and fires correctly

---

## Scheduling Improvements

**Booking Notes**

Add notes directly to bookings from your [calendar](/scheduling/calendar-overview-and-navigation). Notes can be added when creating a booking or [edited afterward](/scheduling/editing-rescheduling-bookings). Perfect for tracking session goals, athlete preferences, or special instructions.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where notes weren't saving when first creating a booking
- Resolved a bug where free schedulers were incorrectly asking for credits

---

## Payments & Billing

**Revenue Sharing Fix**

Products with [revenue sharing](/payments/sharing-rev) enabled now correctly display sales data in the original organization, not just the partner org.

**Transactions Page Default**

The [transactions page](/payments/transactions) now defaults to showing 90 days instead of 7 days, so you see more of your payment history without having to change filters.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed sync issues between Stripe and CoachIQ for transactions
- Resolved cases where payments showed in Stripe but not CoachIQ (and vice versa)
- Fixed subscription cancellation toggle not being respected
- Investigated and resolved double charge reports

---

## Coupons

**Multi-Product Coupons**

You can now select multiple products when restricting a [coupon](/payments/coupon-overview), making it easier to run promotions across related offerings without creating separate coupons for each.

---

## Website Builder

**Navigation Fix**

Fixed an issue where [navigation links](/website/pages-navigation/pages-navigation) were all redirecting to the home page instead of their assigned destinations.

**Header/Logo Overlap**

Resolved UI issue where the [header and navigation](/website/sections/header-footer-navigation) were overlapping with logos on some websites.

**Subheading Font Weight**

Increased the font weight on all subheadings so they stand out better without manual bolding.

**Apostrophe Handling**

Fixed an issue where apostrophes copied from Google Docs weren't transferring correctly to website builder fields.

---

## Native App (iOS & Android)

## Inbox & Messaging

**SMS Message Linking**

**Coach Role Messages**

Resolved a bug where messages from [coach roles](/people/managing-staff) were being sent to admins instead of the intended athletes.

**Phantom SMS Fix**

Fixed an issue where some organizations were seeing SMS messages in their [inbox](/inbox/inbox-overview) despite not having SMS enabled.

---

## Programs & Content

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved access issues for free [programs](/content/programs-overview)

**Profile Link Fix**

Clicking on a user within [form responses](/forms/responses-and-automations) now correctly opens their profile instead of redirecting to the dashboard.

**Athlete Portal Redirect**

Fixed an issue where [embedded forms](/forms/sharing-forms) weren't redirecting to the [athlete portal](/athlete-portal/understanding-your-athlete-portal) after submission, even when configured to do so.

---

## People / CRM

**Bank Credit Display**

Added a toggle to display bank credit amounts in the [people archive view](/people/overview).

---

## Media Hub

**Video/Image Filter**

Added the ability to filter by video or image in the [media center](/content/media-overview) popup within Website Builder, making it easier to find specific content.

**Search Results Fix (Native)**

Fixed issue where search results weren't populating correctly on the native app.

<Update label="November 2025">

## API & Integrations

**Custom Fields via API**

You can now read and write [custom fields](/people/adding-editing-clients#adding-custom-fields) through the CoachIQ API. This opens up powerful integrations - for example, when a lead comes in from Facebook Ads, you can automatically populate custom fields like "source: FB Ads" or UTM campaign data directly into athlete profiles.

**Tags via API**

Add and remove [tags](/people/tags-filters) from athlete profiles through external systems. Combined with custom fields, this enables fully automated lead tracking and segmentation from your marketing tools.

**Phone Number Import Fix**

Fixed an issue with adding phone numbers via N8N and other integration tools.

---

## Payments & Transactions

**Transaction Sync Improvements**

Resolved issues where recent [transactions](/payments/transactions) weren't displaying correctly between Stripe and CoachIQ. Your transaction history now stays in sync reliably.

**Rollover Credits Fix**

Fixed an issue where [rollover credits](/scheduling/recurring-credit-memberships) were being granted even when the subscription was configured not to allow them.

---

## Scheduling

**Booking Error Fix**

Resolved an issue where athletes were receiving "another athlete booked" errors when trying to complete checkout, even when the session was available.

**Reminder Message Fix**

Fixed an issue where athletes were receiving reminder messages that didn't match the [scheduler's configured reminder settings](/scheduling/advanced-scheduler-settings).

---

## Native App (iOS & Android)

We shipped several important fixes to improve the mobile experience this month.

**Inbox Fix**

Fixed an issue where user names were displaying as the admin's name in inbox conversations.

---

## Video & Media

**Video Encoder Update**

Updated the video encoding system to improve reliability when processing uploaded content. Videos should now process more consistently across all formats.

**Program Video Playback**

Fixed an issue where some videos weren't playing within [programs](/content/programs-overview), even though they worked in the [Media Hub](/content/media-overview).

---

## Website Builder
