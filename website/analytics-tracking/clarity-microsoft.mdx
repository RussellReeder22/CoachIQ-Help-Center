## What Clarity shows you

### Heatmaps

Visual maps showing where visitors click, scroll, and move their mouse:

- **Click maps**: See most/least clicked elements
- **Scroll maps**: Discover how far visitors scroll
- **Dead clicks**: Find broken or confusing elements

### Session recordings

Watch anonymous recordings of real visitor sessions:

- See exactly how users navigate
- Identify confusion points
- Understand why visitors leave
- Find broken features or links

### Insights dashboard

Automatic detection of issues:

- **Rage clicks**: Frustrated rapid clicking
- **Dead clicks**: Clicks on non-clickable elements
- **Excessive scrolling**: Users lost on page
- **Quick backs**: Visitors immediately leaving

<Warning>
  **Privacy note**: Clarity automatically masks sensitive information like passwords, credit cards, and personal data. Sessions are anonymous.
</Warning>

## How coaches use Clarity

### Find conversion killers:

- Watch where visitors abandon booking forms
- See if CTAs are being missed
- Identify confusing navigation
- Spot mobile usability issues

### Optimize for bookings:

1. Filter recordings to "didn't convert" sessions
2. Watch 10 recordings to find patterns
3. Fix the most common issues
4. Test and measure improvements

<Tip>
  **Weekly routine**: Every Monday, watch 5 session recordings of visitors who didn't book. You'll quickly spot what needs fixing.
</Tip>

## Best practices

### What to look for in recordings:

- **Booking abandonment**: Why visitors don't complete bookings
- **Form issues**: Fields causing confusion
- **Mobile problems**: Buttons too small or elements overlapping
- **Navigation confusion**: Visitors searching for information
- **Price sensitivity**: Quick exits after seeing pricing

### Heatmap insights:

- Elements with no clicks might be poorly designed
- Heavy clicking on non-links means visitors expect interactivity
- Short scroll depth suggests content isn't engaging
- Mobile vs desktop patterns often differ significantly

## Troubleshooting

<Note>
  **Coach insight**: Most coaches discover their booking button is hard to find on mobile. Check your mobile heatmaps first - that's where most quick wins hide.
