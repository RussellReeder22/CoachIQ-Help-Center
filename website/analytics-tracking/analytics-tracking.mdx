- **Optimize your marketing**: Track which ads and campaigns drive bookings
- **Understand your audience**: Learn where visitors come from and what they're looking for
- **Make data-driven decisions**: Stop guessing and start knowing what grows your business

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need all three tracking tools?">
No, start with Google Analytics as your foundation. Add Facebook Pixel when you run Facebook ads, and Microsoft Clarity when you want to improve user experience. Each tool serves a different purpose.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will tracking slow down my website?">
No, these tracking scripts are optimized and load asynchronously, meaning they won't affect your site's loading speed or user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is tracking free?">
- **Google Analytics**: Free for most coaching businesses
- **Facebook Pixel**: Free (you only pay for ads)
- **Microsoft Clarity**: Completely free with no limits
- **Custom scripts**: Depends on the service
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I add other tracking tools?">
Yes! Use the Custom JS field to add any other tracking scripts like:
- Google Tag Manager
- Hotjar
- LinkedIn Insight Tag
- TikTok Pixel
- Other marketing tools
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long before I see data?">
- **Google Analytics**: 24-48 hours for full data (real-time available immediately)

- **Microsoft Clarity**: 2-3 hours after installation
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Not seeing data?** After adding tracking codes, it can take 24-48 hours for data to appear. Always verify installation using each platform's debugging tools.
</Warning>

### Quick fixes:
