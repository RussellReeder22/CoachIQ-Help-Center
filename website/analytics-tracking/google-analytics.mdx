## What to track for coaching businesses

### Essential metrics to monitor:

- **Users**: How many people visit your site
- **Acquisition**: Where visitors come from (Google, Facebook, direct)
- **Engagement**: Which pages get the most views
- **Conversions**: Track bookings and signups

### Set up conversion events:

1. Track "Book Session" button clicks
2. Monitor form submissions
3. Measure program signups
4. Track phone number clicks

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Set up a weekly email report in Google Analytics to stay informed without logging in daily.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why isn't my data showing?">
    New Google Analytics accounts can take 24-48 hours to start displaying data. If you just added the code, check back tomorrow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between GA4 and Universal Analytics?">
    GA4 is Google's newest analytics platform (IDs start with G-). Universal Analytics (IDs start with UA-) was discontinued in July 2023. Always use GA4 for new setups.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I track multiple websites?">
    Yes, but each website needs its own unique Google Analytics ID. Create separate properties in your GA account for each coaching website.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is Google Analytics GDPR compliant?">
    Yes, but you should update your privacy policy to mention you use Google Analytics and consider adding a cookie consent banner to your website.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ID not saving             | Make sure you're using GA4 format (G-XXXXXXXXXX)             |
| No data after 48 hours    | Verify the ID is correct and try clearing your website cache |
| Can't find Measurement ID | Look for "G-" format in Admin → Data Streams → Web           |
| Old UA code               | Create a new GA4 property - Universal Analytics is retired   |
