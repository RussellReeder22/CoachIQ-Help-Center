## What Facebook Pixel tracks automatically

Once installed, Facebook automatically tracks:
- **PageView**: Every page visit
- **ViewContent**: When someone views your services
- **Contact**: Form submissions
- **Schedule**: Booking interactions
- **Purchase**: Completed transactions

## Set up retargeting audiences

### Create a website visitor audience:
1. Go to **Ads Manager** → **Audiences**
2. Click **Create audience** → **Custom Audience**
3. Choose **Website**
4. Select "All website visitors"
5. Set retention to 30-180 days
6. Name it "Website Visitors - Retargeting"

<Tip>
**Money-saving tip**: Create a custom audience of people who visited but didn't book. These warm leads convert better than cold traffic.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need Facebook Pixel if I'm not running ads yet?">
Yes! Install it now to build your retargeting audience. When you're ready to run ads, you'll already have data on past visitors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Pixel work for Instagram ads too?">
Yes, Facebook Pixel tracks both Facebook and Instagram ads since they use the same advertising platform (Meta).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will it slow down my website?">
No, the Pixel loads asynchronously and won't affect your site speed or user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about iOS 14+ privacy changes?">
Pixel still works but may track fewer conversions. Facebook's Aggregated Event Measurement handles this automatically.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices for coaches

### Conversion events to prioritize:
1. **Book a Session** - Most important for tracking ROI
2. **Contact Form** - Track lead generation
3. **View Schedule** - Shows purchase intent
4. **Sign Up** - Newsletter or program registration

### Retargeting strategy:
- **0-7 days**: Show testimonials and social proof
- **8-30 days**: Offer a free consultation or trial
- **31-90 days**: Share success stories and transformations
- **90+ days**: Seasonal promotions or new programs

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Pixel not detected | Clear cache and wait 20 minutes, then check again |
| Wrong pixel firing | Make sure you only have one Pixel ID entered |
| No conversions showing | Conversions can take 24-48 hours to appear |
| Duplicate events | Check you haven't installed Pixel twice |
