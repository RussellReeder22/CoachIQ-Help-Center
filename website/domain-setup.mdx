## Your Domain is Your Digital Identity

A custom domain transforms your CoachIQ website from a generic URL into a professional coaching brand. Whether you're purchasing your first domain or connecting an existing one, we handle all the technical setup for you.

<Info>
**How it works**: You provide access, we handle everything else. Most domains are connected within 24 hours.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need any technical knowledge?">
Not at all! You just need to know where your domain is registered (GoDaddy, Wix, etc.) and be able to log into that account. We handle all the technical configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will my email stop working?">
No. We're careful to preserve your existing email settings. Your email will continue working exactly as it does now. We only modify the settings that point your website to CoachIQ.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I invite you to my domain account?">
Each provider has a slightly different process, but it's always simple:
- **GoDaddy**: Account Settings → Delegate Access
- **Wix**: Settings → Roles & Permissions
- **Squarespace**: Settings → Contributors
- **Namecheap**: Account → Team Management

We'll send you exact instructions for your specific provider.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I don't know where my domain is registered?">
No problem! Send us your domain name (like yourcoaching.com) and we can look up the registrar for you. We'll then guide you through finding your account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remove your access after setup?">
Absolutely! Once we've configured everything and confirmed it's working, you can remove our access. We only need temporary access for the initial setup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I want to transfer my domain to CoachIQ?">
While most coaches just connect their domain (keeping it at their current provider), we can help you transfer if you prefer to consolidate billing. This is a separate process that takes 5-7 days.
</Accordion>
