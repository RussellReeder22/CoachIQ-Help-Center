### Common text visibility problems

If your published site has missing or invisible text that appears in the editor, you likely have one of these issues:

<Warning>
**Most common causes**:
1. White text on white background
2. Text color set to transparent
3. Theme/section color conflicts
</Warning>

### How to fix invisible text

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify the problem">
Check if your text is visible in the editor but not on the published site. This indicates a color conflict.
</Step>

<Step title="Fix white text on white background">
This commonly happens when:
- You're using dark mode (which defaults to white text)
- Your section background is set to white

**To fix**:
1. Copy your heading text
2. Paste it back in place
3. Highlight the text
4. Click the text color tool
5. Select black or another dark color (not white)
6. Repeat for all affected text

<Frame>
<img src="/images/text-color-selection.png" alt="Selecting text color to fix visibility" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Fix transparent text">
If your text color shows "transparent" in the hex code field:

1. Highlight the affected text
2. Click the color picker
3. Choose any visible color (black, dark gray, etc.)
4. Ensure the hex code field does NOT say "transparent"
5. Apply to all affected text elements

<Note>
**Quick check**: Look for "transparent" in the hex code field - this means your text has no color and won't be visible.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify and publish">
After fixing text colors:
1. Click **Publish**
2. Check your live site
3. Text should now appear as it does in the editor

<Check>
**Success**: Your text is now visible on both the editor and live site!
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best practices for text visibility

<Tip>
**Color contrast rules**:
- Light backgrounds → Dark text (black, dark gray)
- Dark backgrounds → Light text (white, light gray)
- Avoid transparent text unless intentionally hiding content
- Test all sections after theme changes
</Tip>
