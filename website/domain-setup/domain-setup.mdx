## What is a domain?

Your domain is your website's address on the internet (like www.yourcoachingbusiness.com). It's how athletes and parents find you online and a key part of your professional brand. CoachIQ makes it simple to either purchase a new domain or connect one you already own.

<Info>
**Good news**: CoachIQ handles all the technical setup - you just need to provide access to your domain provider account. We'll take care of the DNS settings, SSL certificates, and everything else.

## What you'll need

<Note>
**Before connecting your domain:**
- Access to your domain provider account (login credentials)
- About 10-15 minutes to complete the setup
- Your CoachIQ website should be published and ready

**Important**: After connecting, domain changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate across the internet, though most complete within 2-4 hours.
</Note>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need a custom domain?">
While not required, a custom domain (like www.elitebasketballtraining.com) looks more professional than a generic URL and helps build trust with parents and athletes. It's one of the quickest ways to establish credibility for your coaching business.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does domain connection take?">
The setup process takes about 10-15 minutes. After you complete the steps, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 48 hours for your domain to fully connect (this is called DNS propagation). Most domains connect within 2-4 hours.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use a domain I already own?">
Absolutely! If you already have a domain with any provider, you can connect it to your CoachIQ website. You'll keep ownership of your domain - we're just pointing it to display your CoachIQ site.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my domain provider isn't listed?">
No problem! Our [DNS & Permissions guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions) provides universal instructions that work with any domain provider. You'll just need to access your provider's DNS settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my domain later?">
Yes, you can update or change your domain at any time through your CoachIQ settings. Your website content remains the same - only the web address changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will my email still work after connecting my domain?">
Yes! Connecting your domain to CoachIQ only affects your website. Your email settings remain unchanged and will continue working normally through your current email provider.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Domain not connecting?** If your domain hasn't connected after 48 hours:
- Double-check the DNS settings match exactly what we provided
- Ensure there are no typos in the CNAME or A records
- Clear your browser cache and try accessing your domain
- Check our [DNS & Permissions guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions) for detailed troubleshooting

Still having issues? Contact support with your domain name and we'll help resolve it.
</Warning>

## Pro tips for your domain

<Tip>
**Best practices for coaching domains:**
- Keep it short and memorable (under 15 characters is ideal)
- Include your sport or location if possible (e.g., chicagobasketball.com)
- Stick with .com when available - it's still the most trusted extension
- Avoid hyphens or numbers if possible - they're harder to remember
- Match your domain to your business name for brand consistency
</Tip>
