## Overview

Connecting your Squarespace domain to CoachIQ is straightforward - you'll add our team as a domain manager, and we'll handle all the technical DNS configuration. This process takes about 5 minutes on your end, and your domain will be fully connected within 24-48 hours.

<Info>
**What is a domain manager?** 
A domain manager can configure your domain settings and DNS records but cannot access your billing information or delete your domain. You maintain full ownership and can revoke access anytime.
</Info>

## Before you begin

<Note>
**You'll need:**
- Your Squarespace login credentials
- A Squarespace domain (not attached to a Squarespace website)
- Your CoachIQ website published and ready
</Note>

## Connect your domain

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in to Squarespace">
Visit your [Squarespace domains dashboard](https://account.squarespace.com/domains) and sign in with your email and password.

<Tip>
Make sure you're logging into the account that owns your domain, not a Squarespace website account.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Select your domain">
From your domains dashboard, click on the domain you want to connect to CoachIQ.

If you have multiple domains, choose the one you want to use for your coaching website.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Permissions">
Once in your domain settings, click on **Permissions** in the left menu.

</Step>

<Step title="Invite domain manager">
Click the **Invite domain manager** button.

<Warning>
**No "Invite domain manager" button?**
If this option isn't available, your domain is likely attached to a Squarespace website. You'll need to either:
- Detach the domain from your Squarespace site first, or
- Follow our [manual DNS setup guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions)
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Add CoachIQ team">
Enter the following information exactly as shown:
- **Name**: CoachIQ Support
- **Email**: `liz@coachiq.io`

Click **Send Invitation** to grant access to our team.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirmation">
You'll see a confirmation that the invitation has been sent. Our team will receive an email notification immediately.

<Check>
**Invitation sent!** CoachIQ will accept the invitation and begin configuring your domain.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Notify CoachIQ support">
Send a quick message to our support team letting us know:
- Your domain name
- That you've granted domain manager access

We'll handle the technical configuration and notify you once your domain is connected.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next?

<Info>
**Our team will:**
1. Accept your invitation (within 2-4 hours during business hours)
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings
3. Set up SSL security certificates
4. Test the connection
5. Notify you when everything is complete

**Timeline:** Most domains are fully connected within 24-48 hours.
</Info>

## Domain permission levels explained

</Card>

<Card title="Domain Manager" icon="user-gear">
  **CoachIQ gets this role:**
  - Configure DNS settings
  - Connect domain to sites
  - Manage technical settings
  - No billing or deletion access
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is sharing access safe?">
Yes! Domain manager access is Squarespace's secure way to let professionals help with your domain. We can only access DNS settings - never your billing information or ability to delete your domain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do you need access?">
We typically complete the setup within 24-48 hours. You can keep us as a domain manager for future support needs, or remove access once your domain is connected and working.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I remove access later?">
To remove CoachIQ's access:
1. Go to your [domains dashboard](https://account.squarespace.com/domains)
2. Click your domain
3. Go to **Permissions**
4. Click the three dots (...) next to "CoachIQ Support"
5. Select **Remove domain manager**

Your domain will continue working normally after removing access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My domain is attached to a Squarespace website. What do I do?">
If your domain is connected to an existing Squarespace website, you have two options:
1. **Disconnect from Squarespace site**: Move the domain to standalone management, then follow our guide
2. **Manual setup**: Keep your current setup and follow our [DNS configuration guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions)

Most coaches choose option 2 to avoid disrupting their existing setup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will my email still work?">
Yes! We only modify website-related DNS records. Your email settings (MX records) remain untouched, so your email will continue working exactly as before.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I have Google Workspace through Squarespace?">
Your Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Calendar) will continue working normally. We don't touch email-related settings - only the records that point your domain to your CoachIQ website.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Can't find the Permissions option?**

This usually means your domain is attached to a Squarespace website. You can either:
1. Contact Squarespace support to detach the domain
2. Use our [manual DNS setup guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions)
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Domain not connecting after 48 hours?**

Check that:
- The invitation was sent to `liz@coachiq.io` (exactly as shown)
- Your domain is active and not expired
- The domain isn't attached to a Squarespace website

If everything looks correct, contact our support team with your domain name.
</Warning>

## Alternative: Manual DNS setup

Prefer to handle the technical setup yourself? Check our [DNS & Permissions guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions) for the specific DNS records you'll need to add.

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: If you're comfortable with DNS settings or your domain is attached to a Squarespace website, manual setup might be faster. However, letting our team handle it ensures everything is configured correctly.
</Tip>

## Special note for Google Workspace users

<Info>
**Using Squarespace with Google Workspace?**
If you purchased Google Workspace through Squarespace when buying your domain, all your Google services (Gmail, Drive, Calendar) will continue working normally. We only modify the records that control where your website displays, not your email or other services.
</Info>
