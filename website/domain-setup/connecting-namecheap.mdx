## Overview

Connecting your Namecheap domain to CoachIQ gives you two options: grant our team access to handle everything for you (recommended), or update the DNS records yourself. Both methods take about 5 minutes to set up, with your domain fully connected within 24-48 hours.

<Info>
**Choose your comfort level**: 
- **Account sharing** (recommended) - We handle all technical setup for you
- **Manual DNS** - You control the changes directly
</Info>

## Before you begin

<Note>
**You'll need:**
- Your Namecheap login credentials
- The domain you want to connect
- Your CoachIQ website published and ready
</Note>

## Option 1: Share access with CoachIQ (Recommended)

Let our team handle the technical configuration while you focus on your coaching business.

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in to Namecheap">
Visit [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com) and sign in to your account.

<Tip>
Make sure you're logging in as the account owner, not a sub-account, as only owners can share access.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Access your profile">
Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the dashboard and select **Manage Profile**.

<Step title="Navigate to Account Sharing">
In your profile settings, click on the **Account Sharing** tab.

<Warning>
**Can't see Account Sharing?**
This feature is only available for account owners. If you're using a sub-account, you'll need to either:

<Step title="Notify CoachIQ support">
Send a quick message to our support team letting us know:
- Your domain name
- That you've granted manager access

We'll handle the DNS configuration and notify you once your domain is connected.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: Manual DNS setup

Prefer to handle it yourself? Follow these steps to update your DNS records directly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in to Namecheap">
Visit [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com) and sign in to your account.
</Step>

<Step title="Access your domain">
From your dashboard, find your domain and click **Manage**.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Advanced DNS">
Click on the **Advanced DNS** tab in your domain settings.

<Step title="Add the A Record">
In the **Host Records** section, click **Add New Record** and enter:
- **Type**: A Record
- **Host**: @
- **Value**: `76.76.21.21`
- **TTL**: Automatic

<Step title="Add the CNAME Record">
Click **Add New Record** again and enter:
- **Type**: CNAME Record
- **Host**: www
- **Value**: `website-v1.coachiq.io`
- **TTL**: Automatic

<Warning>
Make sure to enter the CNAME value exactly as shown: `website-v1.coachiq.io` (all lowercase)
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Save your changes">
Click the checkmark or **Save All Changes** button to apply your DNS updates.

<Check>
**DNS records updated!** Your domain will connect to CoachIQ within 24-48 hours as the changes propagate.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next?

<Info>
**Timeline for both methods:**
- **Immediate**: Settings are saved in Namecheap
- **2-4 hours**: DNS changes begin propagating
- **24-48 hours**: Domain fully connected worldwide
- **SSL Certificate**: Automatically configured within 24 hours

Most domains start working within 2-4 hours, though full global propagation can take up to 48 hours.
</Info>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Which method should I choose?">
**Account sharing** is recommended if you want us to handle everything - it's faster and eliminates potential errors. Choose **manual DNS** if you prefer to maintain full control or are comfortable with technical settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is account sharing safe?">
Yes! Namecheap's manager access allows us to configure DNS settings without accessing your billing information or ability to transfer domains. You maintain full ownership and can revoke access anytime.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I remove manager access later?">
To remove CoachIQ's access:
1. Go to your profile settings
2. Click **Account Sharing**
3. Find "liz@coachiq.io" in your managers list
4. Click **Remove** next to our email

Your domain will continue working normally after removing access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will my email still work?">
Yes! We only modify website-related DNS records (A and CNAME). Your email settings (MX records) remain untouched, so your email continues working exactly as before.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I already have DNS records?">
If you have existing A or CNAME records for @ or www, you'll need to update or replace them with our values. Other records (MX, TXT, etc.) should remain unchanged.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use a subdomain instead?">
Yes! Instead of @ and www, you can use a subdomain like "coaching.yourdomain.com". Just replace @ with your subdomain name when adding the A record.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Domain not connecting after 48 hours?**

For **account sharing**, verify:
- Manager email is exactly `liz@coachiq.io`
- You granted DNS management permissions
- Your domain is active and not expired

For **manual DNS**, check:
- A record points to `76.76.21.21`
- CNAME record points to `website-v1.coachiq.io`
- No conflicting records exist
- Records are saved and active
