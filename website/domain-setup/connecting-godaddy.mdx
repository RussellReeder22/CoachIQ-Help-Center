## Overview

Connecting your GoDaddy domain to CoachIQ is simple - you'll grant our team temporary access to configure your domain settings, and we'll handle all the technical work. This process takes about 5 minutes on your end, and your domain will be fully connected within 24-48 hours.

<Info>
**What is delegate access?** 
Delegate access allows CoachIQ's team to manage your domain settings without accessing your payment methods or personal information. You can revoke this access anytime after setup is complete.

## Before you begin

<Note>
**You'll need:**
- Your GoDaddy login credentials
- The domain you want to connect
- Your CoachIQ website published and ready
</Note>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is delegate access safe?">
Yes! Delegate access is GoDaddy's secure way to let professionals help with your domain. We can only access domain settings - never your payment information or personal details. Plus, you can revoke access anytime.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do you need access?">
We typically complete the setup within 24-48 hours. Once your domain is connected and working, you can revoke our access if you'd like, though keeping it active helps if you need future support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I revoke access later?">
Absolutely! To revoke access:
1. Go back to your [Delegate Access page](https://www.godaddy.com/help/invite-a-delegate-to-access-my-godaddy-account-12376)
2. Find "CoachIQ Support" in your delegates list
3. Click "Remove" next to our name

Your domain will continue working normally after removing access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I can't find the Delegate Access page?">
If you're having trouble finding the page:
1. Log into GoDaddy
2. Click your profile name (top right)
3. Select "Account Settings"
4. Look for "Delegate Access" in the left menu

Still can't find it? Contact our support team and we'll walk you through it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will my email still work?">
Yes! We only modify website-related DNS records. Your email settings (MX records) remain untouched, so your email will continue working exactly as before.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I have multiple domains?">
The delegate access covers your entire GoDaddy account, so if you have multiple domains you want to connect, just let us know which ones when you contact support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Domain not connecting after 48 hours?**

Check that:
- The invitation was sent to `dev@coachiq.io` (exactly as shown)
- You selected "Products, Domains, & Purchase" access level
- Your domain is active and not expired

If everything looks correct, contact our support team with your domain name.
</Warning>

## Alternative: Manual DNS setup

Prefer to handle the technical setup yourself? Check our [DNS & Permissions guide](/website/domain-setup/dns-permissions) for the specific DNS records you'll need to add.

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: While delegate access is the easiest method (we handle everything for you), some coaches prefer maintaining full control of their DNS settings. Either method works perfectly - choose what you're most comfortable with.
</Tip>
