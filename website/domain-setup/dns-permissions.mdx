## How to connect your domain

Most domain providers offer a way to share account access or add team members. Here's the universal process:

<Steps>
<Step title="Find your provider's access sharing feature">
Log into your domain provider and look for one of these options:
- **Account Sharing**
- **Team Members**
- **Delegate Access**
- **User Management**
- **Collaborators**
- **Account Permissions**

These are typically found in Account Settings, Security, or Domain Management sections.
</Step>

<Step title="Add CoachIQ support">
Add our team member with these details:
- **Email**: `liz@coachiq.io`
- **Name**: CoachIQ Support
- **Permission Level**: DNS Management, Domain Management, or similar

<Warning>
Make sure the permission level allows DNS editing but doesn't include billing access.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Send the invitation">
Complete the invitation process. Our team will receive notification immediately.

<Check>
**Access granted!** Now notify our support team.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Contact CoachIQ support">
Send us a message with:
- Your domain name
- Your domain provider name
- Confirmation that you've added `liz@coachiq.io`

We'll handle all the technical configuration and notify you once complete.
</Step>
</Steps>

</Step>

<Step title="Add A record">
Create a new A record:
- **Name/Host**: `@` (or leave blank)
- **Value/Points to**: `76.76.21.21`
- **TTL**: 3600 or default
</Step>

<Step title="Add CNAME record">
Create a CNAME record:
- **Name/Host**: `www`
- **Value/Points to**: `website-v1.coachiq.io`
- **TTL**: 3600 or default
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Save all DNS changes. Your domain will connect within 24-48 hours.
</Step>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is it safe to grant access?">

You maintain full ownership and can revoke access anytime.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my provider has no sharing option?">

<Accordion title="How do I revoke access later?">
Once your domain is connected:
1. Return to your provider's access sharing settings

3. Remove or revoke access

Your domain continues working after removing access.

<Accordion title="Will my email still work?">
Yes! We only modify website records (A and CNAME). Your email records (MX) remain untouched, so email continues working normally.

<Accordion title="What's the timeline?">
