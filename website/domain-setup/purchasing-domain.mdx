## Domain selection best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes a good coaching domain?">
    The best coaching domains are:

    - Short and memorable (under 15 characters)
    - Include your business name, sport, or location
    - Easy to spell and pronounce
    - End in .com when possible
    - Match your social media handles if available

    Examples: miamiqbtraining.com, elitehoopsacademy.com, smithspeedtraining.com
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I buy multiple extensions (.com, .net, .org)?">
    For most coaches, just .com is sufficient. Only consider multiple extensions if:

    - You have a unique brand name you want to protect
    - You plan to build a large multi-location business
    - The .com is taken but .net/.org are available

    Focus your budget on marketing rather than defensive domain purchases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much should I expect to pay?">
    - **Standard .com domains**: \$12-20/year
    - **Premium domains**: \$50-500+/year (popular keywords)
    - **Other extensions** (.net, .org): \$10-25/year
    - **New extensions** (.coach, .training): \$30-70/year

    Most coaches do perfectly well with a standard .com domain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I buy a domain elsewhere?">
    Yes! You can purchase from any domain registrar (Namecheap, Bluehost, etc.) and connect it to CoachIQ. We recommend GoDaddy and Squarespace because we have specific guides for them, making the connection process easier.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After your purchase

<Warning>
  **Important timing notes:**

  - Domain activation: 24-48 hours (sometimes faster)
  - DNS propagation after connecting: 2-48 hours
