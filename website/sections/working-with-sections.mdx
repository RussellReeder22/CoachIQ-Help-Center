    Look for the reorder controls next to the section name in the left sidebar by hovering over the section with your mouse.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many sections can I add to a page?">
    There's no strict limit on the number of sections you can add, but keep user experience in mind. Pages that are too long may lose visitor attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I copy sections between pages?">
    While you can't directly copy sections, you can recreate similar sections by selecting the same section type and configuring it with the same content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to hidden sections?">
    Hidden sections are saved in your Website Builder but don't appear to visitors. They don't affect your site's loading speed or SEO.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I undo removing a section?">
    No, removing a section permanently deletes it. If you might need the section later, use the Hide option instead.
  </Accordion>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Plan your layout**: Before adding sections, sketch out your ideal page flow. Start with essential sections like hero, about, services, and contact.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Hide for testing**: When trying new section layouts, hide existing sections instead of removing them so you can easily revert changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Mobile preview**: After reordering sections, always check how your page looks on mobile devices to ensure good user experience.
