    Look for the reorder controls next to the section name in the left sidebar by hovering over the section with your mouse.

    To make the section visible again, simply toggle the Hide option back off.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many sections can I add to a page?">
    There's no strict limit on the number of sections you can add, but keep user experience in mind. Pages that are too long may lose visitor attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I copy sections between pages?">
    While you can't directly copy sections, you can recreate similar sections by selecting the same section type and configuring it with the same content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to hidden sections?">
    Hidden sections are saved in your Website Builder but don't appear to visitors. They don't affect your site's loading speed or SEO.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I undo removing a section?">
    No, removing a section permanently deletes it. If you might need the section later, use the Hide option instead.
  </Accordion>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Plan your layout**: Before adding sections, sketch out your ideal page flow. Start with essential sections like hero, about, services, and contact.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Hide for testing**: When trying new section layouts, hide existing sections instead of removing them so you can easily revert changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Mobile preview**: After reordering sections, always check how your page looks on mobile devices to ensure good user experience.
