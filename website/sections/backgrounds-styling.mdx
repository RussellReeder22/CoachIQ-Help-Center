    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adjusting section spacing

Control how much space your sections take up on the page using the vertical padding controls.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Vertical Padding control">
    In your selected section's settings panel under **Change Section Styles**, find the **Vertical Padding** slider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust the spacing">
    Move the slider to increase or decrease the amount of space above and below your section content.

    - **Less padding**: Creates tighter, more compact sections
    - **More padding**: Provides breathing room and emphasizes content

    <Note>
      Vertical padding affects the space inside the section, not the space between sections.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check mobile appearance">
    Preview how your padding adjustments look on mobile devices to ensure good user experience.

    <Check>
      Your section now has the optimal amount of spacing for your content.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting section width

Control how wide your section content appears on the page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Width controls">
    Look for the **Width (Default)** setting in your section panel under **Change Section Styles**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your width option">
    Select the width that works best for your content:

    - **Default width**: Standard container width that works for most content
    - **Custom width**: Adjust the slider to make sections wider or narrower
    - **Full width**: Extends content across the entire browser window

    <Tip>
      **Content consideration**: Text-heavy sections often work better with default or narrower widths for better readability.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview across devices">
    Check how your width settings look on desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

    <Check>
      Your section content now displays at your preferred width.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why isn't my background image showing up?">
    Check that your image file is in a supported format (JPG, PNG, WebP) and isn't too large. Also ensure the image has been properly uploaded to your media library.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I make sections look consistent across my site?">
    Use the same background colors, similar padding amounts, and consistent width settings across sections of the same type. Create a style guide for your brand colors and stick to it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between hiding a section and hiding styles?">
    Hiding a section removes it completely from your live site. Hiding styles keeps the section visible but removes the visual styling (background, colors, etc.).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use different backgrounds for desktop and mobile?">
    Background settings apply to both desktop and mobile. However, you can preview how backgrounds look on different devices and adjust accordingly.
  </Accordion>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Visual hierarchy**: Use different background colors or padding to create visual separation between different types of content sections.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Image optimization**: When using background images, choose high-quality images that don't interfere with text readability. Consider adding a dark overlay for sections with white text.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Consistent spacing**: Use similar padding amounts for sections of the same importance level to create a cohesive look throughout your site.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test thoroughly**: Always preview your styling changes on both desktop and mobile devices before publishing your site.
