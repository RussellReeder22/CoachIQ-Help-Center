## Setting button destinations

Choose where you want visitors to go when they click your buttons.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access button destination options">
    With a button selected, look for the destination or link settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your destination type">
    Select from the available destination options:

    - **Direct users to CoachIQ login** - Send visitors to your member portal
    - **Direct users to a page** - Link to another page on your website
    - **Direct users to a form** - Send visitors to a contact or signup form
    - **Direct users to a product** - Link directly to a service or product for purchase
    - **Direct users to a program** - Connect to a training program or course
    - **Direct users to a session** - Link to session booking or scheduler
    - **Direct users to a url** - Link to any external website
    - **Scroll to first form** - Automatically scroll to the first form on the page
    - **Scroll to a section** - Jump to a specific section on the same page

    <Tip>
      **Conversion tip**: Use "Direct users to a session" for your primary booking buttons and "Scroll to first form" for lead capture buttons.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure destination details">
    Depending on your choice, you may need to:

    - Select a specific page, form, product, or session
    - Enter a URL for external links
    - Choose which section to scroll to

    <Check>
      Your button now has a clear destination and purpose.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Button display settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set opening behavior">
    Choose whether links open in the same window or a new window:

    - **Same window**: Keeps visitors on your site (recommended for internal links)
    - **New window**: Opens external links without losing your visitors

    <Note>
      The "In a new window" toggle is especially useful for external links to maintain visitor engagement on your site.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Control button visibility">
    Use the **Hide this link** option to temporarily remove a button without deleting it:

    - **Visible**: Button appears to all visitors
    - **Hidden**: Button is temporarily hidden but settings are preserved
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Button text and styling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit button text">
    Update the text that appears on your button to be clear and action-oriented:

    - **Good examples**: "BOOK YOUR FIRST CLASS", "START TRAINING", "GET STARTED"
    - **Avoid**: Generic text like "Click here" or "Learn more"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep text concise">
    Button text should be short and clearly communicate the action:

    - Use 1-4 words when possible
    - Make the benefit clear
    - Create urgency when appropriate

    <Tip>
      **Action-oriented language**: Use verbs that tell visitors exactly what will happen - "Book", "Start", "Join", "Download".
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which sections support buttons?">
    Most content sections support buttons, including Hero, Content + Media, Features, and Pricing sections. The button options will appear in the section settings if the section type supports them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many buttons can I add to a section?">
    The number varies by section type. Most sections allow multiple buttons, but the layout may determine the optimal number for good user experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between scrolling to a form vs linking to a form?">
    "Scroll to first form" moves visitors down to a form on the same page, while "Direct users to a form" can link to a form on a different page or a standalone form.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I open external links in a new window?">
    Yes, use "In a new window" for external links to keep visitors from leaving your site completely. Keep internal links in the same window for better user flow.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Primary vs secondary actions**: Use your most important call-to-action (like "Book Session") as the primary button, and secondary actions (like "Learn More") as less prominent buttons.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Button placement strategy**: Put your strongest call-to-action buttons above the fold (visible without scrolling) and repeat key actions in multiple sections.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test your buttons**: Click through all your buttons regularly to ensure they're working correctly and leading to the right destinations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Mobile optimization**: Preview your buttons on mobile devices to ensure they're easily tappable and clearly visible on smaller screens.
</Tip>
