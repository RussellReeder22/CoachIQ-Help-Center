## What are website sections?

Website sections are the customizable building blocks that make up the main content area of your CoachIQ website. They sit between your header and footer, allowing you to organize and present your coaching content exactly how you want it.

<Info>
Each section serves a specific purpose - from showcasing your training programs to collecting leads through contact forms. You can add, reorder, and customize sections to create the perfect layout for your sports coaching business.
