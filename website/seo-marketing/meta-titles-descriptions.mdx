## Why meta information matters

When parents search "basketball training near me," Google shows them a list of results. Each result has a **title** (the blue clickable link) and a **description** (the snippet below it). These two elements determine whether someone clicks on your site or scrolls past.

Getting this right isn't about gaming the system - it's about clearly communicating what you offer so the right parents find you.

<Note>
**CoachIQ advantage**: We optimize your main pages when building your site. This guide helps you maintain that quality as you add new pages or want to refine your messaging.
</Note>

## Meta titles: Your first impression

The meta title is the single most important on-page SEO element. It appears in:
- Search engine results (the blue clickable link)
- Browser tabs
- Social media shares
- Bookmarks

### Writing effective titles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do This" icon="check">
    - Keep under 60 characters
    - Put important keywords first
    - Include your location
    - Make it compelling to click
    - Use your business name
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid This" icon="xmark">
    - Going over 60 characters (gets cut off)
    - Keyword stuffing
    - Generic titles like "Home"
    - ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
    - Duplicate titles across pages
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Title formula that works

**Structure**: [Primary Service] + [Location] | [Business Name]

**Examples:**

| Page | Good Title | Why It Works |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Home | Basketball Training Austin \| Elite Skills Academy | Service + location + brand |
| Programs | Youth Basketball Programs Dallas \| Ages 8-18 | Service + location + detail |
| Pricing | Private Training Rates \| Elite Skills Academy Austin | Service + brand + location |
| Camps | Summer Basketball Camp 2026 \| Austin TX | Service + timing + location |

<Tip>
**Character count tool**: Google "character counter" to quickly check your title length. Anything over 60 characters gets truncated with "..." in search results.
</Tip>

## Meta descriptions: Your elevator pitch

The meta description is your chance to convince searchers to click. While it doesn't directly impact rankings, it heavily influences click-through rates.

### Anatomy of a great description

**Length**: 150-160 characters (the sweet spot)

**Must include:**
1. What you offer (your service)
2. Who it's for (age group, skill level)
3. Why choose you (unique value)
4. Call-to-action (what to do next)

- [ ] Unique (not copied from other pages)

## Keyword strategy for coaches

Keywords are the words and phrases parents type into Google. Understanding keyword strategy helps you appear in the right searches.

### Three types of keywords

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Service Keywords (What you do)">
    These describe your offerings:
    - Basketball training
    - Private coaching
    - Youth sports lessons
    - Skills development
    - Group training sessions

    **Use in**: Titles, descriptions, page content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Location Keywords (Where you are)">
    Geographic terms that help local searches:
    - [City name]
    - [Neighborhood]
    - Near me (Google understands this)
    - [Surrounding cities you serve]

    **Use in**: Titles, descriptions, every page
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Long-tail Keywords (Specific searches)">
    More specific phrases with less competition:
    - "Private basketball shooting coach North Dallas"
    - "Youth soccer training for beginners Austin"
    - "Summer basketball camp ages 10-12 Plano"

    **Use in**: Blog posts, FAQ sections, specific program pages
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Finding your keywords

Think about what parents actually search for:

**Research phase** (just looking):
- "Benefits of sports training for kids"
- "When to start basketball training"
- "Private coaching vs group training"

**Comparison phase** (evaluating options):
- "Best basketball coaches in [city]"
- "Youth sports training near me"
- "[Your name] reviews"

**Ready to book** (buying intent):
- "Book basketball training [city]"
- "Private soccer lessons availability"
- "Sign up youth basketball camp"

<Tip>
**Quick research**: Type your service + city into Google and see what autocomplete suggests. These are real searches people make.
</Tip>

### Where to place keywords

**High priority locations:**
- Page title (most important)
- First paragraph of content
- Headers (H1, H2)
- Image alt text

**Secondary locations:**
- Meta description
- Throughout body content (naturally)
- URL/page slug
- Internal link text

<Warning>
**Don't keyword stuff**: Writing "basketball training" 50 times won't help you rank. Google prioritizes natural, helpful content. If it sounds robotic to read, rewrite it.
</Warning>

## Common mistakes to avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using the same title for every page">
    Each page needs a unique title. Duplicate titles confuse search engines and miss opportunities to rank for different keywords.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Writing for search engines, not humans">
    If your title or description sounds unnatural, rewrite it. Real humans need to want to click. "Basketball Training Basketball Coach Basketball Austin TX" is spam, not optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forgetting the call-to-action">
    Every description should tell people what to do: "Book today," "Get started," "See pricing," "Join now." Give them the next step.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ignoring your competition">
    Search for your keywords and see what competitors write. Don't copy them, but understand what you're competing against.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Setting and forgetting">
    Review your meta information quarterly. Services change, locations expand, and messaging evolves. Keep it current.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should I change the titles CoachIQ created?">
    Only if your business has changed (new location, rebranding, new services) or you're adding new pages. The initial optimization is professional-grade.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long until changes show in Google?">
    Google typically re-crawls active sites within days to weeks. Major changes may appear faster. You can request indexing through Google Search Console.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do keywords in the meta keywords field affect rankings?">
    Google has stated they don't use the meta keywords tag for ranking. However, it helps organize your own SEO strategy and may help other search engines.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my business serves multiple cities?">
    Create location-specific pages or mention multiple cities naturally in your content. Your home page might target your primary city while blog posts target surrounding areas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I include my phone number in descriptions?">
    Generally no - it takes up valuable character space. People will find contact info once they click through to your site.
  </Accordion>
