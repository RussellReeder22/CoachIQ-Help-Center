## Your website's SEO foundation

When we build your CoachIQ website, our team implements professional SEO optimization from day one. We handle the technical complexity - page titles, meta descriptions, headers, image optimization, and URL structure - so you launch with a site that's engineered to rank.

Understanding these elements helps you maintain and enhance what we've built as your business grows.

<Note>
**The CoachIQ advantage**: Your website comes pre-optimized by professionals who understand both SEO and the sports coaching industry. This foundation typically takes months to build from scratch.
</Note>

## Understanding keywords for coaches

Keywords aren't mysterious - they're simply the words parents type into Google when looking for training. Understanding how they work helps you make smarter content decisions.

### The keyword spectrum

There's a huge difference between broad and specific keywords:

**Broad keywords** (high competition, low conversion):
- "Basketball coach"
- "Soccer training"
- "Sports lessons"

**Local intent keywords** (medium competition, high conversion):
- "Basketball coach in Dallas"
- "Youth soccer training Austin"
- "Private baseball lessons near me"

**Specific buyer keywords** (lower competition, highest conversion):
- "Private basketball shooting coach North Dallas"
- "U12 soccer skills training Cedar Park"
- "College prep quarterback coach Plano TX"

<Tip>
**The sweet spot**: Focus on local intent and specific buyer keywords. You'll never outrank Nike for "basketball training," but you can dominate "basketball training in [your city]."
</Tip>

### How parents actually search

Understanding search behavior helps you match their intent:

**Research phase** (just looking):
- "Benefits of sports training for kids"
- "When to start basketball training"
- "Cost of private coaching"

**Comparison phase** (evaluating options):
- "Best basketball coaches in [city]"
- "Youth sports training programs near me"
- "[Your name] reviews"

**Ready to book** (buying intent):
- "Book basketball training [city]"
- "Private soccer coach availability"
- "Sign up youth sports training"

### Where keywords naturally belong

Keywords should appear naturally in your content, not forced:

**Primary locations**:
- Page titles (most important)
- Main headers (H1 tags)
- First paragraph of content
- Image alt text
- URL structure

**Secondary locations**:
- Subheaders (H2, H3 tags)
- Throughout body content
- Image file names
- Meta descriptions
- Internal link text

<Warning>
**Avoid keyword stuffing**: Writing "basketball training" 50 times won't help you rank. Google prioritizes natural, helpful content that actually serves parents and athletes.
</Warning>

## The five SEO elements on your pages

Understanding these elements helps you appreciate what CoachIQ optimizes and how to maintain it:

### 1. Page titles (your first impression)

Your page title is the blue clickable link in Google search results. It's the single most important on-page SEO element.

**What we optimize for you**:
- Strategic keyword placement
- Compelling language that encourages clicks
- Proper length (under 60 characters)
- Location and service inclusion

**Example of optimized titles**:
Basketball Training in Austin | Elite Skills Academy
Private Soccer Coaching Dallas | Transform Your Game
Youth Baseball Lessons Phoenix | Professional Development

### 2. Meta descriptions (your elevator pitch)

The meta description is the snippet of text below your title in search results. While it doesn't directly impact rankings, it heavily influences click-through rates.

**What makes them effective**:
- 150-160 characters (the sweet spot)
- Include a clear value proposition
- Add a call-to-action
- Mention location and primary service

**Example descriptions**:
Professional basketball training in Austin for ages 8-18.

### 3. Headers (your content structure)

Headers organize your content for both humans and search engines:

- **H1**: Main page title (one per page)
- **H2**: Major sections
- **H3**: Subsections
- **H4-H6**: Additional levels (rarely needed)

**Why structure matters**:
- Helps Google understand your content hierarchy
- Makes content scannable for parents
- Natural places for keywords
- Improves user experience (which Google measures)

### 4. Image optimization (often overlooked)

Images can drive traffic through Google Images and improve page context:

**Alt text purpose**:
- Describes image for visually impaired users
- Helps Google understand image content
- Provides keyword context
- Shows if image fails to load

**Good alt text examples**:
- "Youth basketball shooting form training in Dallas gym"
- "Coach Mike teaching soccer dribbling drills to U12 team"
- "Private baseball pitching lessons at Austin facility"

**File naming best practices**:
- `basketball-training-dallas.jpg` ✅
- `IMG_12345.jpg` ❌

### 5. URL structure (keep it clean)

URLs should be readable and descriptive:

**Good URL structure**:
- `/basketball-training-austin`
- `/private-coaching-sessions`
- `/youth-programs/summer-camps`

**Poor URL structure**:
- `/page1`
- `/services-new-final-2`
- `/index.php?id=123`

<Note>
**Remember**: CoachIQ creates optimized URLs automatically when we build your site. Maintain this structure as you add new pages.
</Note>

## Creating content that ranks

While your main pages are optimized at launch, understanding content principles helps when you add blog posts or new pages:

### The location + service formula

The most effective content formula for local businesses:

**Structure**: [Service] + [Location] + [Unique Value]

**Examples**:
- "Basketball Skills Training in North Dallas for College-Bound Athletes"
- "Youth Soccer Development Program in Austin's Northwest Hills"
- "Private QB Coaching in Plano with Former NFL Player"

### Writing naturally vs keyword stuffing

**Natural writing** (Google loves this):
"Our basketball training program in Dallas helps young athletes develop fundamental skills through personalized coaching. Located in North Dallas, we serve athletes from Richardson, Plano, and Frisco."

**Keyword stuffing** (Google penalizes this):
"Basketball training Dallas, basketball coach Dallas, Dallas basketball training, youth basketball Dallas, Dallas basketball coach, basketball lessons Dallas, Dallas basketball program."

### Using your blog strategically

Your CoachIQ blog isn't just for updates - it's an SEO opportunity:

**High-value blog topics**:
- "How to Prepare for Basketball Tryouts in [City] High Schools"
- "Summer Training Schedule for [Local Team] Athletes"
- "Best Parks for Soccer Practice in [Your Area]"
- "[Local Tournament] Preparation Guide"

**Why local content works**:
- Less competition than generic topics
- Highly relevant to your actual customers
- Builds local authority
- Natural keyword integration

<Tip>
**Blog strategy**: Write about local sports events, specific schools, area tournaments, and seasonal training. This local focus attracts parents in your area, not random visitors from across the country.
</Tip>

### Internal linking between pages

Connecting related pages helps both users and search engines:

**Good internal linking**:
- Link from your blog to service pages
- Connect related programs
- Link testimonials to relevant services
- Create logical user journeys

**Example in context**:
"Our [summer basketball camp](link) builds on skills taught in our [private training sessions](link). Many athletes also join our [strength and conditioning program](link) for complete development."

## Common SEO mistakes to avoid

### Mistakes that hurt rankings

**Over-optimization**:
- Stuffing keywords everywhere
- Creating pages for every keyword variation
- Unnatural anchor text in links
- Hidden text or sneaky tactics

**Duplicate content issues**:
- Copying content from other sites
- Having multiple pages with same content
- Not customizing template text

**Inconsistent business information**:
- Different phone numbers on different pages
- Varying business names
- Multiple address formats
- Mismatched hours of operation

**Ignoring your blog**:
- Never adding new content
- Writing off-topic posts
- Not linking to service pages
- Missing local focus

**Breaking what's already working**:
- Changing optimized titles without reason
- Deleting pages that rank well
- Removing content Google has indexed
- Major changes without understanding impact

<Warning>
**Before hiring an SEO agency**: Many agencies promise rankings but don't understand local service businesses. Before spending thousands on SEO services, check with CoachIQ support. We can guide you on whether external help makes sense and what to look for. Often, the basics we've built are all you need.
</Warning>

### Red flags from SEO agencies

Be cautious if an agency:
- Guarantees #1 rankings (nobody can guarantee this)
- Won't explain their methods
- Focuses on generic keywords instead of local
- Promises hundreds of backlinks
- Suggests major site changes without clear reasoning
- Doesn't ask about your actual business goals

<Tip>
**Smart approach**: Master Google My Business and reviews first (free and powerful), understand the SEO foundation CoachIQ provides, then consider additional optimization only when you're ready to scale aggressively.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need to edit the SEO settings CoachIQ created?">
Generally no. We optimize your pages professionally at launch. Only make changes if you rebrand, add new services, or expand to new areas. If unsure, ask support before making changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I start a blog for SEO?">
A blog helps if you'll consistently publish local, relevant content. Writing about local tournaments, training tips for area schools, and seasonal programs can boost rankings. Random or infrequent posts won't help.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if my SEO is working?">
Track: (1) Your Google rankings for "[sport] training [city]", (2) Website traffic from Google, (3) Calls and inquiries mentioning Google, (4) Your position in map results. Progress typically shows within 3-6 months.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I do SEO myself or need an agency?">
Start with the foundation CoachIQ provides plus Google My Business and reviews. This handles 80% of local SEO. Only consider an agency when you're ready to aggressively expand and have budget for ongoing optimization.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's more important - website SEO or Google My Business?">
Google My Business drives more immediate local traffic, but website SEO provides long-term authority. Do both, but prioritize GMB if you must choose. Fortunately, CoachIQ handles website SEO, so you can focus on GMB.
