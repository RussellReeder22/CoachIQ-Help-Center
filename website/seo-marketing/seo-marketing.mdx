## What SEO actually means for coaches

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) isn't about tricking Google or learning code. It's simply making sure parents and athletes can find you when they search for training in your area.

When someone types "basketball training near me" or "youth soccer coach [your city]," SEO determines whether they find you or your competitor.

<Note>
**The CoachIQ advantage**: We build your initial website with SEO best practices baked in - from proper page structure to optimized content. You get a professionally optimized site from day one, then have full control to expand and enhance it.
</Note>

## The three pillars of local search visibility

Understanding these three pillars puts you ahead of 90% of coaches who either ignore SEO completely or get lost in complexity:

## How local search actually works

Understanding the basics helps you make smarter decisions about your online presence:

### The local search algorithm

When parents search for coaches, Google evaluates three key factors:

1. **Relevance** - How well you match what they're searching for
2. **Distance** - How close you are to the searcher
3. **Prominence** - How well-known and trusted your business is

### What Google sees when evaluating coaches

**Relevance signals:**
- Keywords on your website matching the search
- Business categories in your Google My Business
- Services and descriptions across all platforms
- Content depth about your specific sport

**Distance signals:**
- Your physical location or service area
- The searcher's location (mobile or desktop)
- "Near me" modifiers in searches

**Prominence signals:**
- Number and quality of Google reviews
- Consistency of business information across the web
- Website traffic and engagement
- Age and authority of your domain
- Local media mentions and citations

<Note>
**Key insight**: You can't change your location, but you can maximize relevance and prominence. This is where professional optimization makes the difference between page 1 and invisibility.
</Note>

## Why most coaches fail at SEO

### Common pitfalls to avoid:

- Launching a website and never updating it
- Creating GMB profile once and abandoning it
- Ignoring reviews and citations

- Wasting time on tactics that don't work for local businesses

**The "ignoring the basics" error**
- Perfect website but no Google My Business
- Great content but no reviews
- Multiple listings with inconsistent information

## The compound effect of good SEO

SEO isn't a one-time task - it's a compound investment that grows over time:

**Foundation**

- Google starts understanding your business
- Initial rankings for your business name

**Momentum**

- Reviews begin accumulating
- Rankings improve for service keywords

**Acceleration**

- Reviews and citations reinforce authority

**Domination**
- Top 3 rankings for competitive keywords
- Become the obvious choice in your area

<Check>
**The reality**: Good SEO is like compound interest - small, consistent improvements create exponential results over time. Starting with a professionally optimized site accelerates this timeline significantly.
