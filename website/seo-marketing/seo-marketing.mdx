## What SEO means for coaches

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is how parents and athletes find you when they search for training in your area. When someone types "basketball training near me" or "youth soccer coach [your city]," SEO determines whether they find you or your competitor.

<Note>
**The CoachIQ advantage**: Your website comes pre-optimized with professional SEO - proper page structure, meta tags, mobile optimization, and fast hosting. You get a head start that typically takes months to build from scratch.
