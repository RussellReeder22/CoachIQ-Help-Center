**Where to find this**: Use this guide after setting up Google My Business to maximize your online presence across all platforms parents check.
</Info>

## Be everywhere parents look

You've optimized your Google My Business profile (which drives 80% of your local visibility). Now let's capture the remaining 20% by claiming your business on every other platform parents check when researching coaches.

The best part? With your GMB profile complete, you already have everything needed to set these up in one focused afternoon.

<Note>
**The compound effect**: Each listing reinforces the others. When Google sees consistent business information across the web, it trusts you more and ranks you higher. This is called NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone), and it's SEO gold.
</Note>

## Your copy-paste kit

Before starting, create a document with this information ready to copy-paste into each platform:

<Steps>
<Step title="Gather your business information">
Create a master document with:

**Basic Information**
- Business name (exactly as on GMB)
- Address (or service area)
- Phone number
- Website URL (your CoachIQ site)
- Email address
- Hours of operation

**Business Descriptions**
Write three versions:

**Short (150 characters)**
"Elite [sport] training for ages [X-Y]. Private & group sessions. [Years] experience developing athletes. Book online at [website]."

**Medium (300 characters)**
"Professional [sport] skills training specializing in [specialties]. Coach [Name] brings [years] years experience developing [achievements]. Offering private sessions, small groups, and camps for ages [X-Y]. Proven system for athlete development. Schedule your free assessment at [website]."

**Long (750 characters)**
[Use your GMB description]
</Step>

<Step title="Prepare your photos">
Have these ready in a folder:
- Logo/headshot (profile photo)
- Action shot coaching (cover photo)
- Facility photos (3-5 angles)
- Athletes training (3-5 with permission)
- Certifications/credentials
- Group training or camp photos

<Tip>
Name your files descriptively: "coach-mike-basketball-training-facility.jpg" helps with SEO on platforms that read file names.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="List your services">
Standard services list with prices:
- Private Training ($X)
- Small Group Training ($X)
- Team Training ($X)
- Camps/Clinics ($X)
- Virtual Coaching ($X)

Keep descriptions to one sentence each.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Quick wins: Major platforms (15 minutes each)

### Apple Maps Connect

**Why it matters**: iPhone users (50% of U.S. smartphones) see Apple Maps results in Siri, Spotlight search, and Maps app.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Apple Business Connect">
1. Go to [register.apple.com/business](https://register.apple.com/business)
2. Sign in with Apple ID (or create one)
3. Click "Add a place"
</Step>

<Step title="Enter business details">

</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Bing Places for Business

**Why it matters**: Powers results for Bing, Yahoo, Alexa, and Cortana. Popular with older demographics (many sports parents).

<Steps>
<Step title="Import from Google My Business (easiest method)">
1. Go to [bingplaces.com](https://www.bingplaces.com)
2. Sign in with Microsoft account
3. Click "Import" → "Google My Business"

<Steps>
<Step title="Claim your business">
1. Go to [biz.yelp.com](https://biz.yelp.com)
2. Search for your business

4. If not, add it via "Add a Business"
</Step>

<Step title="Complete your profile">

- Write your "From the Business" description
- Add a "Call to Action" button linking to CoachIQ
</Step>

<Step title="Verify ownership">
- Usually phone call verification

<Warning>
Yelp has strict rules about asking for reviews. Never incentivize Yelp reviews or ask for them directly. Let them happen naturally.

## Local and community directories

### City Recreation Department

Most cities list private coaches who use public facilities or offer complementary training.

**How to get listed**:

2. Ask about their "instructor registry" or "approved vendors list"
3. Complete any required insurance/background check documentation
4. Submit your business information
5. Often free or low annual fee

<Note>
Being on the city's list adds massive credibility. Parents trust city-vetted coaches.
</Note>

### Local Sports League Directories

**Where to list**:
- Youth league websites (Little League, AYSO, Pop Warner)
- High school athletic department resources
- Club team partner pages
- Tournament organizer vendor lists

**How to approach**:
Email template:
"Hi [League Administrator], I provide professional [sport] training for youth athletes and would love to be added to your recommended training resources for parents. Many of your players already train with me, including [names if permitted]. Could you add my business information to your website's resource page?"

### Chamber of Commerce

If you're serious about business growth, join your local Chamber.

**Benefits**:
- Directory listing on Chamber website
- Networking with other businesses
- Referrals from Chamber members
- Enhanced credibility
- Often includes ribbon cutting for new businesses

Cost: Usually $200-500/year (tax deductible)

### Local Parenting Magazines/Websites

Every city has parenting publications with online directories.

**Common names to search**:
- "[City] Parent Magazine"
- "[City] Family Magazine"
- "[Metro Area] Kids Directory"
- "Macaroni Kid [Your Area]"

Most offer free basic listings with optional paid upgrades.

## Monthly maintenance checklist

Set a recurring reminder for the first Monday of each month:

### 10-Minute Quick Check
- [ ] **Consistency audit**: Open all platforms and verify NAP is identical
- [ ] **Hours update**: Adjust for holidays, camps, or seasonal changes
- [ ] **New photos**: Add 1-2 fresh photos to Facebook and Instagram
- [ ] **Review check**: Respond to any new reviews on Yelp or Facebook

### Quarterly Deep Update
- [ ] **Refresh descriptions**: Update achievements, new certifications, or programs
- [ ] **Service updates**: Add new offerings or adjust prices
- [ ] **Photo refresh**: Swap out old photos for recent ones
- [ ] **Link check**: Ensure all links point to correct CoachIQ pages

### Annual Audit
- [ ] **Platform audit**: Check for new platforms to join
- [ ] **Remove duplicates**: Search for and merge any duplicate listings
- [ ] **Competitive analysis**: See where competitors are listed that you're not

<Tip>
**Pro automation**: Use a tool like BrightLocal or Yext to manage all listings from one dashboard. Costs $20-50/month but saves hours and ensures consistency.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Which platforms are actually worth my time?">
**Must-haves**: Google My Business (already done), Facebook Business, Apple Maps
**Worth it**: Yelp, Nextdoor, Instagram location
**Only if time**: Bing, Chamber, local directories

Focus on where YOUR specific parent demographic spends time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my business already exists on these platforms?">
Great! Claim it immediately. Unclaimed listings often have wrong information and missed opportunities. Claiming gives you control to optimize and respond to reviews.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I pay for premium listings?">
Only on Facebook (for ads) once you're getting results from free listings. Yelp advertising is expensive and often not worth it for coaches. Nextdoor ads can be effective for camps and special programs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle different locations?">
If you train at multiple fixed locations, create separate listings for each. If you're mobile or use temporary spaces, use one listing with service areas. Keep it simple - parents just need to find you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about sports-specific platforms?">
Most aren't worth it unless you're targeting college recruiting (then consider NCSA) or teaching pros (certification body directories). Parents don't search these platforms for youth coaching.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
