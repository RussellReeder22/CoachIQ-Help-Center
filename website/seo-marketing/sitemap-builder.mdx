## What is a sitemap?

A sitemap is a file that tells search engines (like Google) which pages exist on your website. When Google crawls your site, it uses the sitemap to discover and index your pages.

Think of it as a table of contents for search engines - if a page isn't in your sitemap, Google might not find it (or might take longer to discover it).

## Why control your sitemap?

Not every page should appear in Google search results. You might want to hide:

- **Thank you pages** after form submissions
- **Landing pages** for specific ad campaigns
- **Duplicate content** pages
- **Pages under construction** that aren't ready yet
- **Private pages** meant only for existing clients

<Note>
Hiding a page from the sitemap doesn't make it inaccessible - people with the direct link can still visit it. It just tells Google not to index it in search results.

## Using the Sitemap Builder

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Page Visibility">
    Each page shows:
    - **Page title** (what appears in search results)
    - **URL slug** (the page path like `/about`)
    - **Eye icon** (visibility toggle)

    Click the **eye icon** to toggle visibility:
    - **Eye visible** = Page IS included in sitemap (Google can index it)
    - **Eye crossed out** = Page is NOT in sitemap (hidden from Google)

    <Frame>
      ![Page hidden from sitemap](/images/website-sitemap-page-hidden.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Close and Publish">
    Close the modal and click **Publish** to update your sitemap.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to hide pages from sitemap

| Page Type | Hide from Sitemap? | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Home, About, Services | No | Core pages should be indexed |
| Contact, Pricing | No | People search for these |
| Thank You pages | Yes | No search value, clutters results |
| Ad landing pages | Sometimes | Depends if you want organic traffic |
| Test/draft pages | Yes | Not ready for public |
| Duplicate pages | Yes | Avoid SEO penalties |

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does hiding a page from the sitemap make it private?">
    No. Anyone with the direct link can still visit the page. Sitemap visibility only affects search engine indexing. For truly private pages, you'd need authentication/login requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long until Google notices the change?">
    Google typically re-crawls sitemaps within days to weeks. You can speed this up by submitting your sitemap in Google Search Console.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my page disappear from Google immediately?">
    No. Removing a page from your sitemap tells Google to stop including it, but existing indexed pages may remain in search results for weeks until Google re-crawls your site.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I hide my blog posts?">
    Generally no - blog posts are great for SEO and bringing organic traffic. Only hide them if they're outdated or no longer relevant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I see my actual sitemap file?">
    Your sitemap is automatically generated at `yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`. You can visit this URL to see exactly what Google sees.

## Pro tip: Submit your sitemap to Google

After making changes, submit your sitemap to Google Search Console for faster indexing:

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Select your property
3. Navigate to **Sitemaps** in the left menu
4. Enter `sitemap.xml` and click **Submit**

See our [Google Search Console guide](/website/seo-marketing/seo-google-search-console) for detailed setup instructions.
