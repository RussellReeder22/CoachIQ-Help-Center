<Info>
**What you'll accomplish**: Connect your CoachIQ website to Google Search Console so Google can properly index your site and show it to potential clients searching for coaching services.
</Info>

## Why this matters

Google Search Console is a free tool that helps Google understand and display your coaching website in search results. Without it, potential clients may have trouble finding you when they search for coaching services in your area.

**What you'll get:**
- Better visibility in Google search results
- Insights into how people find your site
- Alerts about any technical issues affecting your search ranking
- Control over how Google indexes your content

<Note>
**Time required**: 10-15 minutes for initial setup. Google typically takes 2-3 days to begin showing your site in search results.
</Note>

## Before you begin

You'll need:
- A published CoachIQ website
- A Google account (Gmail works perfectly)
- Access to your domain settings (usually through your domain provider)

## Step-by-step setup guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Google Search Console">
Open your web browser and search for "Google Search Console" or go directly to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console).

Click **Start now** to begin the setup process.

Sign in with the Google account you want to use for managing your website analytics. Your personal Gmail account works great for this.
</Step>

<Step title="Add your CoachIQ website">
You'll see two options on the welcome screen:
- **Domain** (left side)
- **URL prefix** (right side)

For your CoachIQ site, choose **URL prefix**.

Paste your complete website URL (for example: `https://yourcoachingname.com`) and click **Continue**.

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Make sure to include the `https://` at the beginning of your URL and don't add a trailing slash at the end.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify site ownership">
Google needs to confirm you own this website before giving you access to its data.

The easiest verification method is through your domain manager:
1. Google will show several verification options
2. Look for the automatic verification option through your domain provider
3. Follow the prompts to connect and verify

If automatic verification isn't available, Google will guide you through alternative methods like adding a special code to your site or DNS records.

<Check>
**Success!** Once verification succeeds, you'll see a confirmation message and be taken to your Search Console dashboard.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Submit your sitemap">
A sitemap tells Google about all the pages on your site. CoachIQ automatically creates one for you.

In the left sidebar of Search Console, navigate to **Indexing** → **Sitemaps**.

In the "Add a new sitemap" field at the top of the page, enter:
```
sitemap.xml
```

Click **Submit**.

<Note>
Your complete sitemap URL will be your website address + `/sitemap.xml`. For example: `https://yourcoachingname.com/sitemap.xml`
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm successful submission">
After submitting, refresh the page and look under "Submitted sitemaps".

You should see your sitemap listed with a status that shows:
- **Success** (ideal - means Google accepted it)
- **Pending** (normal - Google is processing it)

If you see any errors, double-check that you entered `sitemap.xml` correctly.

<Warning>
It typically takes 2-3 days for Google to fully process your sitemap and begin showing your pages in search results. Be patient - this is completely normal!
</Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Optimizing your CoachIQ site for better SEO

Once your site is connected to Google Search Console, maximize your search visibility by optimizing these CoachIQ features:

### Website content optimization

**Page titles and descriptions**
Every page on your CoachIQ site should have:
- Clear, descriptive titles that include relevant keywords (e.g., "Youth Soccer Training - [Your Name] Coaching")
- Compelling meta descriptions that encourage clicks
- Your location for local search visibility

**Quality content**
- Write detailed service descriptions explaining what makes your coaching unique
- Include testimonials and success stories
- Regularly update your blog or resources section
- Use natural language that your ideal clients would search for

### Local SEO settings

If you coach in a specific area, make sure to:
1. Add your complete business address in your CoachIQ site settings
2. Include your city/region in page titles and content
3. Create location-specific service pages if you serve multiple areas
4. Embed a Google Map showing your training location

### Mobile optimization

Your CoachIQ website is automatically mobile-friendly, but you can help SEO by:
- Keeping paragraphs short and scannable
- Using clear headings and subheadings
- Ensuring images load quickly
- Testing your site on your phone regularly

### Technical SEO (handled automatically)

CoachIQ takes care of these technical elements for you:
- Fast page loading speeds
- Secure HTTPS connection
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clean URL structure
- Automatic sitemap generation

## Monitoring your search performance

### Using Search Console insights

After a few weeks of data collection, check your Search Console regularly:

**Performance report** (left sidebar)
- See which search terms bring people to your site
- Identify your most popular pages
- Track clicks, impressions, and average position
- Compare performance over time

**Coverage report**
- Confirm all your important pages are indexed
- Identify and fix any errors preventing pages from appearing in search

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Check Search Console monthly to spot trends and opportunities. If certain keywords perform well, create more content around those topics!
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How long before I see results in Google search?">
After submitting your sitemap, expect:
- **2-3 days**: Google begins crawling your site
- **1-2 weeks**: Pages start appearing in search results
- **4-12 weeks**: Noticeable improvement in search rankings

SEO is a long-term strategy. Consistent, quality content and proper setup yield the best results over time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to resubmit my sitemap when I update my site?">
No! CoachIQ automatically updates your sitemap whenever you make changes to your website. Google will regularly check for updates on its own.

However, you can manually request Google to re-crawl your site in Search Console if you've made major changes and want them indexed faster.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my sitemap shows errors?">
First, double-check that you entered `sitemap.xml` correctly in Search Console.

If errors persist:
1. Verify your CoachIQ website is published (not in draft mode)
2. Check that your domain is properly connected
3. Wait 24-48 hours as sometimes errors resolve automatically
4. Contact CoachIQ support if issues continue

Common error causes are usually temporary and related to DNS propagation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Search Console with a custom domain?">
Absolutely! In fact, custom domains (like yourcoaching.com) perform better in search results than CoachIQ subdomains.

The setup process is identical - just use your custom domain URL when adding your property to Search Console.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I connect Google Analytics too?">
Yes! While Search Console shows how people find your site through search, Google Analytics shows what they do once they arrive.

Together, these tools give you complete visibility into your website performance and help you optimize for more client conversions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between 'Domain' and 'URL prefix' verification?">
**URL prefix** (recommended for most coaches):
- Easier to set up
- Works immediately with CoachIQ sites
- Tracks one specific version of your site (https://yoursite.com)

**Domain**:
- Tracks all versions (www, non-www, http, https) in one property
- Requires DNS record changes
- More complex setup but cleaner long-term

For most coaching businesses, URL prefix is the simpler and perfectly adequate choice.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Verification fails

**If automatic verification doesn't work:**
1. Try the HTML tag method - Google will provide a code snippet
2. Contact CoachIQ support to help you add the verification code
3. Alternatively, use the DNS verification method through your domain provider

### Sitemap not found

**If Google can't find your sitemap:**
- Ensure your CoachIQ website is published (not in draft)
- Verify you're using the correct format: `sitemap.xml` (not your full URL)
- Check that your domain is properly connected and active
- Wait 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate if you recently connected a custom domain

### No data showing in Search Console

**If your dashboard is empty after several days:**
- This is normal for brand new websites - it takes time to gather data
- Verify your sitemap was successfully submitted
- Check that your site has actual content published (not just a coming soon page)
- Share your website on social media and other platforms to help Google discover it

<Warning>
**Still having issues?** Take a screenshot of the error message you're seeing in Search Console and [contact CoachIQ support](/support/contact-us). We can help identify the specific issue and guide you through the solution.
</Warning>

## Pro tips for maximum SEO impact

- **Use keywords naturally**: Include terms your ideal clients search for, but write for humans first
