## Why Google My Business matters for coaches

When parents search for "basketball training near me" or "soccer coach [your city]," Google My Business (GMB) determines whether they find you or your competition. Your GMB profile appears in three critical places:

<Frame>
  ![Gmbsearchresult Pn](/images/gmbsearchresult.png)
</Frame>

1. **Google Maps** - Where parents look for nearby training facilities
2. **Local Pack** - The top 3 businesses shown in search results
3. **Knowledge Panel** - The info box that appears when someone searches your business name

<Note>
  **The reality**: 86% of people look up business locations on Google Maps, and 76% of local searches result in a visit within 24 hours. Without GMB, you're invisible to most potential clients.
</Note>

## How GMB drives new athlete signups

Your Google My Business profile acts as your 24/7 sales rep:

- **Instant credibility**: Reviews and ratings build trust before parents even visit your website
- **Direct bookings**: Athletes can click to call, visit your website, or get directions immediately
- **Free advertising**: Posts and updates appear directly in search results at no cost
- **Competitive edge**: Most coaches ignore GMB, giving you a massive advantage

<Tip>
  **CoachIQ Integration**: Your GMB profile links directly to your CoachIQ website, creating a seamless journey from discovery to booking. Parents find you on Google, click through to your professional website, and book sessions‚Äîall in minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or claim your business">
    Visit [business.google.com](https://business.google.com) and sign in with a Google account.

    **If you're brand new:**

    - Click "Add your business to Google"
    - Enter your exact business name (e.g., "Elite Basketball Training LLC")

    **If your business might exist:**

    - Search for your business name
    - If found, click "Claim this business"
    - If not found, click "Add your business to Google"

    <Warning>
      Never create duplicate listings. If you find an existing listing for your business, always claim it rather than creating a new one.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your business type">
    Select the option that best fits your coaching business:

    - **Have a physical location customers visit** - If you have a dedicated gym or facility
    - **Deliver services to customers** - If you travel to athletes or use various locations

    <Note>
      If you train at multiple locations (parks, school gyms, clients' homes), choose "Deliver services" and set your service area.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your business information">
    Fill in these critical details exactly as they appear on your CoachIQ website:

    **Business Name**: Use your official coaching business name **Category**: Start typing and select the most specific option:

    - First choice: "Basketball coach" or "[Your sport] coach"
    - Alternative: "Sports coaching" or "Athletic training"
    - Add secondary categories later for more visibility

    **Service Area** (if applicable): Add all zip codes or cities you serve **Phone Number**: Use your primary business number **Website**: Your CoachIQ website URL (e.g., yourname.coachiq.io or your custom domain)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your business">
    Google needs to confirm you're the real owner. Verification options:

    1. **Postcard by mail** (most common) - Takes 5-14 days
    2. **Phone verification** (if eligible) - Instant
    3. **Email verification** (if eligible) - Within 24 hours
    4. **Video verification** (select businesses) - 5 business days

    <Tip>
      While waiting for verification, you can still complete your profile. You just can't publish it publicly until verified.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

- Respond to all reviews
- Update hours for holidays/camps
- Check and respond to questions
- Review insights and adjust strategy
- Verify NAP consistency across all platforms
- Add any new services or programs

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple locations on one GMB account?">
    Yes! If you train at different facilities, you can create separate listings for each location. However, if you're mobile and travel to clients, use one listing with service areas instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long before I see results?">
    Most coaches see increased visibility within 2-4 weeks of optimization. Reviews and regular posts speed this up significantly. Expect 3-6 months for full local domination.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if someone left a fake negative review?">
    First, respond professionally. Then flag it for Google if it violates policies (fake, spam, or from competitor). Document everything and consider having satisfied clients leave positive reviews to offset it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I pay for Google Ads too?">
    GMB is free and should be optimized first. Once you're getting consistent results, Google Ads can amplify your reach, especially for competitive keywords or seasonal camps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I beat established competitors in rankings?">
    Focus on what you can control: more reviews, fresher content (posts/photos), complete profile information, and consistent NAP across the web. Newer businesses can outrank established ones with better optimization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
