## Why these settings matter

When someone shares your website on Facebook, LinkedIn, or iMessage, what do they see? When parents have 20 browser tabs open, can they find your site? These seemingly small details create a professional impression that builds trust.

**Favicon**: The small icon that appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screens

**Share Image (Open Graph)**: The preview image that appears when your pages are shared on social media or messaging apps

<Note>
Getting these right means your coaching business looks established and professional - not like a hobby project someone started yesterday.
</Note>

## Setting up your favicon

Your favicon is the tiny icon that represents your website everywhere browsers display it:
- Browser tabs
- Bookmarks bar
- Browser history
- Mobile home screen (when saved)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Website Settings">
    From your Website Builder, click the **Settings** gear icon in the left sidebar.

    <Frame>
      ![Website settings gear location](/images/website-settings-gear-location.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Your Favicon">
    In the Settings panel, find the **Add Favicon** section at the top. Click **Select Media** to choose or upload your icon.

    <Frame>
      ![Favicon upload settings](/images/website-settings-favicon-upload.png)
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
    **Recommended specs**: 50x50 pixels, PNG format. Use a simple version of your logo that's recognizable at small sizes.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview and Publish">
    After selecting your image, click **Publish** to make your favicon live. It may take a few minutes for the change to appear in all browsers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Favicon best practices

**Do:**
- Use a simplified version of your logo
- Keep it recognizable at 16x16 pixels
- Use high contrast colors
- Test how it looks against both light and dark browser themes

**Don't:**
- Use text (it's too small to read)
- Use complex images with lots of detail
- Use your full logo with tagline
- Leave it as the default

<Warning>
**No favicon = amateur hour**: Parents notice when a website has the generic browser icon. It's a small detail that signals whether you're running a professional operation.
</Warning>

## Setting up share images (Open Graph)

Open Graph images are what people see when your website is shared on:
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X
- iMessage
- Slack
- Text messages with link previews

Each page on your site can have its own share image, so your home page, pricing page, and camp registration can all show relevant previews.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Page to Edit">
    In the Website Builder, select the page you want to add a share image to from the dropdown menu.

    <Frame>
      ![Page settings annotated](/images/website-page-settings-annotated.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Page Settings">
    Click on any section, then look for the **Page Settings** panel on the left side. You'll see fields for Title, Keywords, Featured Image, and Description.

    <Frame>
      ![Page SEO settings](/images/website-page-seo-settings.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Your Featured Image">
    Click the **Featured Image** dropdown and select or upload an image. This becomes your Open Graph image - what appears when this page is shared.

    <Tip>
    **Recommended size**: 1200 x 630 pixels for optimal display across all platforms.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Your Changes">
    Click **Publish** to make your share image live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Share image best practices

**Image specifications:**
- Ideal size: 1200 x 630 pixels
- Minimum size: 600 x 315 pixels
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Under 1MB for fast loading

**Content tips:**
- Include your logo or business name
- Use compelling visuals (action shots of training)
- Keep text minimal and large enough to read
- Use your brand colors for consistency

**What works well:**
- Action shots from training sessions
- Your facility with logo overlay
- Team or group training images
- Before/after skill development photos

<Warning>
**Test before you share**: Use [Facebook's Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) or [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/) to preview how your page will look when shared.
</Warning>

## Page-specific SEO settings

While you're in Page Settings, optimize these fields for each page:

### Title
The page title appears in:
- Browser tabs
- Search engine results
- Social media shares

**Best practices:**
- Keep under 60 characters
- Include your location and primary service
- Put important keywords first

**Example**: "Basketball Training Austin | Elite Skills Academy"

### Description
The meta description appears in:
- Search engine results
- Some social media shares

**Best practices:**
- Keep between 150-160 characters
- Include a clear value proposition
- Add a call-to-action
- Mention your location

**Example**: "Professional basketball training in Austin for ages 8-18. Build skills, confidence, and game IQ with former college players. Book your free assessment today!"

### Keywords
Target keywords help search engines understand your page content.

**Best practices:**
- Use 3-5 relevant keywords per page

- Avoid keyword stuffing

**Good keywords**: "basketball training austin, youth basketball coach, private basketball lessons"

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why isn't my new favicon showing up?">
    Browsers cache favicons aggressively. Try:
    1. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
    2. Clear your browser cache
    3. Open the site in an incognito/private window
    4. Wait 24 hours for DNS caches to update
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My share image isn't updating on Facebook">
    Facebook caches share images. Use the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and click "Scrape Again" to force Facebook to fetch your new image.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't have a logo?">
    Use a simple text-based image with your business name in your brand colors. Canva offers free templates for creating favicons and social share images.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need different images for each page?">
    Your home page definitely needs a share image. For other pages, it depends on whether you'll share them directly. Camp registration pages, pricing pages, and program pages benefit from custom images.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What size should my favicon be?">
    Upload at 50x50 pixels or larger. CoachIQ will automatically generate the various sizes needed for different devices and browsers.
  </Accordion>
