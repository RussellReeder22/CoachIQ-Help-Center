## Why redirects matter

When you change a page URL or delete a page, anyone with the old link gets a "Page Not Found" error. This includes:

- **Google search results** still pointing to old URLs
- **Social media posts** you've shared
- **Backlinks** from other websites
- **Bookmarks** parents have saved
- **QR codes** on printed materials

A redirect automatically sends visitors from the old URL to the new one - no broken links, no lost traffic.

<Warning>
**SEO impact**: Broken links hurt your search rankings. Google sees 404 errors as a sign of poor site maintenance. Redirects preserve your SEO value by telling Google "this page moved here."
</Warning>

## Setting up redirects

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Website Settings">
    In the Website Builder, click the **Settings** gear icon in the left sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open URL Redirects">
    Scroll to **URL Redirects** and click **View/Edit**. The redirect manager opens.

    <Frame>
      ![URL redirects modal](/images/website-url-redirects-modal.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Redirect">
    Fill in both fields:

    | Field | What to Enter | Example |
    |-------|--------------|---------|
    | **Redirect From** | The old URL path (without domain) | `/summer-camp` |
    | **Redirect To** | The new URL path or full external URL | `/summer-camp-2026` |

    Click the **+** button to add another redirect if needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Publish">
    Close the modal and click **Publish** to activate your redirects.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Redirect examples

### Renaming a page

You renamed "Summer Camp" to "Summer Camp 2026":

| Redirect From | Redirect To |
|--------------|-------------|
| `/summer-camp` | `/summer-camp-2026` |

### Deleting a page

You removed your "Evaluations" page and want visitors to see "Programs" instead:

| Redirect From | Redirect To |
|--------------|-------------|
| `/evaluations` | `/programs` |

### Redirecting to external site

You want an old page to go to your booking calendar:

| Redirect From | Redirect To |
|--------------|-------------|
| `/book-now` | `https://cal.com/your-calendar` |

<Tip>
**External URLs**: When redirecting to a different website, enter the full URL including `https://`.
</Tip>

## Using wildcards

Wildcards let you redirect multiple pages at once using `*` as a placeholder.

**Example**: You restructured your site and moved all camp pages under a new path:

| Redirect From | Redirect To |
|--------------|-------------|
| `/camps/*` | `/programs/camps/*` |

This redirects:
- `/camps/summer` → `/programs/camps/summer`
- `/camps/winter` → `/programs/camps/winter`
- `/camps/spring-break` → `/programs/camps/spring-break`

<Note>
**Wildcard syntax**: Use `/*` at the end of a path to match all sub-pages. For example, `/old-section/*` catches everything under that section.
</Note>

## When to use redirects

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Renamed a page | Redirect old slug → new slug |
| Deleted a page with traffic | Redirect → most relevant existing page |
| Restructured site sections | Use wildcards for bulk redirects |
| Migrating from old website | Redirect old URLs → new equivalents |
| Seasonal pages | Redirect last year's camp → this year's |
| Typos in shared links | Redirect typo → correct URL |

## Common mistakes to avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Redirect chains (A → B → C)">
    Don't create chains where one redirect leads to another redirect. This slows down page loading and confuses search engines. Always redirect directly to the final destination.

    **Bad**: `/old` → `/temporary` → `/final`
    **Good**: `/old` → `/final`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redirect loops (A → B → A)">
    Never create a loop where pages redirect to each other. This breaks the page completely. Double-check your redirect destinations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forgetting the leading slash">
    Always include the `/` at the start of your paths.

    **Correct**: `/summer-camp`
    **Incorrect**: `summer-camp`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redirecting your home page">
    Be very careful redirecting `/` (your home page). This affects your entire site's entry point. Only do this if you're absolutely sure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing your redirects

After publishing, test your redirects:

1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Visit your old URL directly (e.g., `yourdomain.com/old-page`)
3. Verify you land on the new page
4. Check that the browser URL shows the new address

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Keep a list of your redirects somewhere (spreadsheet, notes) so you remember what points where. This helps when troubleshooting or making future changes.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many redirects can I create?">
    There's no hard limit, but keep your redirect list manageable. Too many redirects can slow site performance and become difficult to maintain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do redirects affect page speed?">
    Slightly. Each redirect adds a small delay (usually milliseconds). This is almost always worth it compared to broken links, but avoid unnecessary redirect chains.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I redirect to a specific section of a page?">
    Yes, you can include anchor links. For example: `/old-faq` → `/about#faq` would redirect to the FAQ section of your About page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I remove a redirect?">
    In the URL Redirects modal, click the **X** button next to the redirect you want to remove, then publish your changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Google update its search results?">
    Yes, but it takes time. Google will eventually crawl the redirect and update its index. You can speed this up by requesting re-indexing in Google Search Console.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
