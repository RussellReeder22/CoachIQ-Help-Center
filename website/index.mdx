## What is the Website Builder?

The CoachIQ Website Builder is your all-in-one tool for creating a professional online presence without needing any technical skills. Unlike traditional website builders, we've designed this specifically for sports coaches and training facilities, with pre-built sections that showcase your programs, handle bookings, and convert visitors into paying clients.

## Website Builder components

Your website consists of three main elements:

### 1. Pages

Individual pages like Home, About, Programs, or Contact. Each page can have its own unique layout and purpose.

### 2. Sections

Pre-built content blocks that you stack to create pages. Think of these like building blocks - headers, galleries, testimonials, pricing tables, etc.

### 3. Global Elements

Components that appear across all pages:

- **Header**: Logo, navigation menu, and action buttons
- **Footer**: Contact info, social links, and additional navigation

<Note>
  Your website automatically syncs with other CoachIQ features. When you create a new program or update your schedule, your website reflects these changes instantly.
