## Best practices for template usage

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Choose the right template for your content">
Don't force content into the wrong template. If you're creating a training program page, use the "Training Programs" template rather than trying to modify a "Contact" template. The right template saves time and provides better structure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Customize thoroughly, don't leave placeholders">
Templates include placeholder text to show you what content should go where. Always replace ALL placeholder content with your specific information. Generic placeholder text looks unprofessional and hurts SEO.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maintain consistent branding across templates">
While templates provide structure, ensure your content maintains consistent tone, terminology, and branding across all pages. This creates a cohesive experience for your website visitors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep legal templates current and compliant">
Legal page templates provide a starting point, but laws vary by location and change over time. Consider having legal pages reviewed by a professional, especially for privacy policies and terms of service.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use service templates to highlight your unique approach">
Training and service templates provide standard coaching industry structure, but customize them to showcase what makes your coaching unique - your methodology, results, specializations, and success stories.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Template-specific tips

### For legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms, Disclaimers)
- **Update regularly**: Laws change, especially privacy regulations
- **Include your contact info**: Required for many legal frameworks
- **Link prominently**: Add to footer navigation for easy access
- **Keep language clear**: Avoid overly complex legal jargon when possible

### For service pages (Training Programs, Online Coaching)
- **Include pricing**: If you offer standard rates
- **Add booking buttons**: Link to your [scheduling system](/schedule/overview)
- **Show results**: Include testimonials and success metrics
- **Highlight unique value**: What sets your coaching apart

### For sign-up pages (Registration, Trials)
- **Minimize form fields**: Only ask for essential information
- **Clear value proposition**: Explain what they get by signing up
- **Connect to payments**: Link to your [products and billing](/payments/overview)
- **Set expectations**: Timeline, next steps, what to bring

## Common questions about templates

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I modify template sections after creating the page?">
Yes! Templates provide the initial structure, but you can add, remove, or modify sections just like any other page. The template is just a starting point to save you time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I don't see a template for what I need?">
Use the "Default" template for custom content needs, or choose the closest template and modify it. You can always add or remove sections to match your specific requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change templates after creating a page?">
While you can change templates, you may lose customized content. It's usually better to manually add or remove sections rather than switching to a completely different template.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need legal pages for my coaching website?">
Most coaching businesses benefit from having privacy policies (especially if you collect email addresses or use analytics), terms of service, and liability waivers. Check your local requirements and consider legal consultation for high-liability activities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use the same template multiple times?">
Absolutely! You can create multiple pages from the same template. For example, use the "Training Programs" template for different sports or age groups you coach.
</Accordion>
