## What you'll accomplish

Create professional legal pages (privacy policy, terms of service, and disclaimers) for your coaching website using CoachIQ's built-in templates, customize them for your business, and publish them to your footer navigation.

## Why legal pages matter for coaches

Essential legal pages protect your coaching business and build trust with potential clients. These legal documents are especially important when you're:
- Collecting personal information through forms
- Processing payments and storing billing data  
- Working with minors (requiring waivers)
- Operating in multiple states or countries

### When legal pages become legally required

Legal pages aren't just best practice—they're often required by law:
- **Privacy policies**: Required when collecting any personal data (names, emails, phone numbers)
- **Terms of service**: Required for payment processing and subscription services
- **Disclaimers**: Essential for liability protection in fitness and sports coaching

<Note>
**Compliance note**: Most payment processors (including Stripe) require privacy policies and terms of service before processing payments for your coaching business.
</Note>

<Note>
**Legal disclaimer**: These templates provide a starting point but should be reviewed by a qualified attorney for your specific business needs and jurisdiction.
</Note>

## Creating terms & conditions

<Steps>
<Step title="Follow the same process">

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What legal documents do I need for my coaching business?">
At minimum, most coaching businesses need: **Privacy Policy** (required for data collection), **Terms of Service** (required for payments), and **Liability Disclaimer** (essential for physical training). Additional documents like liability waivers, photo releases, and medical clearance forms may be needed depending on your services.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I really need all three legal pages?">
**Privacy Policy** is required if you collect any personal information (names, emails, etc.). **Terms & Conditions** are essential for payment processing and service agreements. **Disclaimers** are critical if you provide physical training or work with minors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How often should I update my legal pages?">
Review them at least annually or whenever you make significant changes to your services, pricing, or data collection practices. Always update the "last modified" date when you make changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use the same legal pages for multiple coaching locations?">
You may need location-specific legal pages if you operate in different states or countries with varying laws. Consult with an attorney familiar with your jurisdictions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about liability waivers for in-person training?">
Legal pages on your website complement but don't replace physical liability waivers. You may still need clients to sign separate waiver forms before participating in physical activities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do these templates work internationally?">
The templates are primarily based on US law. If you serve international clients or operate outside the US, consult with an attorney familiar with applicable international privacy laws (like GDPR).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting legal pages

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Legal page isn't showing in footer">
Ensure you've published both the legal page and your website. Check that the footer link destination is set correctly to your legal page (not an external URL).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Template content looks unprofessional">
This is normal - templates use placeholder text. You must customize every section to reflect your actual business practices and policies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't find the legal page templates">
Make sure you're clicking **Add New Page** → **Templates** (not trying to add a section to an existing page). Legal templates appear alongside other page templates.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
