## Understanding your coaching website structure

Your CoachIQ website uses a hierarchical page structure that makes it easy for athletes and parents to find information about your coaching services. Pages can be standalone or organized as parent pages with subpages, creating logical navigation paths.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many pages should my coaching website have?">
    Most successful coaching websites have 5-10 pages total. Start with essential pages (Home, About, Services, Contact) and add specialized pages as your business grows. Focus on quality content that serves your athletes and parents rather than creating many pages with thin content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete pages after creating them?">
    Yes, you can delete pages through the page management interface. However, be careful not to delete pages that are linked in your navigation menus, [scheduling system](/scheduling/overview), or [payment products](/payments/product-overview). Always update your navigation and remove internal links before deleting pages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between page templates?">
    Templates provide pre-built layouts optimized for different content types. "Training Programs" templates include sections for service descriptions, pricing, and booking buttons. "About" templates focus on coach credentials and philosophy. "Contact" templates emphasize forms and location information. Choose the template that best matches your page's purpose.

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Before creating many pages, sketch out your ideal website structure on paper. Consider your coaching services, target audience (parents, athletes, or both), and the journey you want visitors to take from first discovery to booking their first training session. This planning prevents navigation confusion later.
