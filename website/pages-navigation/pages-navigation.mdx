## Configuring header and footer navigation

### Setting up header navigation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access header navigation settings">
    Look for **Header**, **Navigation**, or **Menu** settings in your Website Builder interface. This is typically found in the main sections or a dedicated navigation area.

    <Frame>
      ![Web Builder Navigation Pn](/images/web-builder-navigation.png)
    </Frame>
    <Info>
      **Location varies**: Navigation settings may be in the header section, main builder area, or a dedicated navigation panel depending on your website template.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add main navigation items">
    Configure your primary header menu with essential coaching pages:

    - Home
    - About
    - Training Programs (or Services)
    - Contact

    <Tip>
      **Professional appearance**: Keep your main navigation to 4-6 items for a clean, professional look that doesn't overwhelm visitors.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure dropdown menus">
    For parent pages with subpages, set up dropdown navigation:

    1. Select "Training Programs" in navigation settings
    2. Add submenu items linking to each subpage:
       - In-Person Training → Link to in-person training page
       - Online Coaching → Link to online coaching page
       - Group Sessions → Link to group sessions page

    <Note>
      **Dropdown best practices**: Use dropdowns sparingly and ensure they work well on mobile devices where most parents browse.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add call-to-action buttons">
    Include prominent action buttons in your header:

    - "Book Session" or "Schedule Training"
    - "Free Consultation"
    - "Get Started"

    Link these buttons to your [booking system](/schedule/bookings) or [contact forms](/tools/forms).

  <Step title="Access footer settings">
    Find the **Footer** section in your Website Builder, typically listed in the main sections or site structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add footer navigation links">
    Include secondary navigation items in your footer:

    - Privacy Policy
    - Terms of Service
    - Blog or News (if applicable)
    - Additional service pages

    <Note>
      **Footer purpose**: Footer navigation is perfect for legal pages, secondary content, and links that support your main navigation without cluttering it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Include contact information">
    Add essential contact details to your footer:

    - Phone number
    - Email address
    - Training location/address

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many pages should my coaching website have?">
    Most successful coaching websites have 5-10 pages total. Start with essential pages (Home, About, Services, Contact) and add specialized pages as your business grows. Focus on quality content that serves your athletes and parents rather than creating many pages with thin content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete pages after creating them?">
    Yes, you can delete pages through the page management interface. However, be careful not to delete pages that are linked in your navigation menus, [scheduling system](/schedule/overview), or [payment products](/payments/products). Always update your navigation and remove internal links before deleting pages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between page templates?">
    Templates provide pre-built layouts optimized for different content types. "Training Programs" templates include sections for service descriptions, pricing, and booking buttons. "About" templates focus on coach credentials and philosophy. "Contact" templates emphasize forms and location information. Choose the template that best matches your page's purpose.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I have pages that aren't in the main navigation?">
    Yes! You can create pages for specific purposes (like thank-you pages after form submissions, specific landing pages for marketing campaigns, or detailed service pages) that aren't included in your main navigation. These pages are still accessible via direct links but don't clutter your main menu.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I make my navigation mobile-friendly?">
    CoachIQ websites are automatically mobile-optimized, but you should test your navigation on a phone. Keep menu items short and descriptive, use clear hierarchy with logical dropdowns, and ensure touch navigation works smoothly. The preview feature shows how your navigation appears on mobile devices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my navigation structure after my website is live?">
    Absolutely! You can add, remove, or reorganize pages and navigation at any time using the Website Builder. However, major structural changes might temporarily affect your search engine rankings, so it's best to plan your structure carefully during initial setup and make incremental improvements rather than complete overhauls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I include pricing in my navigation?">
    This depends on your coaching business model. If you have standard pricing, including a "Pricing" page in navigation can help qualify leads. If you offer custom coaching packages, you might prefer to discuss pricing during consultations. Consider your target market and how price-sensitive your coaching services are.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do navigation and SEO work together?">
    Good navigation structure helps search engines understand your website and improves user experience, both important for SEO. Use descriptive page names with relevant coaching keywords, create logical page hierarchies, and ensure all important pages are accessible within a few clicks from your homepage.

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Before creating many pages, sketch out your ideal website structure on paper. Consider your coaching services, target audience (parents, athletes, or both), and the journey you want visitors to take from first discovery to booking their first training session. This planning prevents navigation confusion later.
