## What you'll accomplish

Customize your page URLs to look professional and improve SEO by removing auto-generated numbers and creating clean, memorable links.

**Time required**: 2-3 minutes per page

## Understanding URL slugs

The **slug** is the part of your website URL that comes after your domain:

- Your domain: `yourcoachingsite.com`
- Page slug: `/about`
- Full URL: `yourcoachingsite.com/about`

### Why clean URLs matter for coaches

- **Professional credibility**: `coachsmith.com/basketball-training` looks more trustworthy than `coachsmith.com/page-1755106901008`
- **Easy sharing**: Parents can easily remember and share `yoursite.com/camps` with other parents
- **Better SEO**: Search engines prefer descriptive URLs with relevant keywords

## How to update your URL slugs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Page Settings">
    In Website Builder, select the page you want to edit and click **Page Settings** in the left panel.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/pagesettingslocation.png"
        alt="Page Settings panel location in CoachIQ Website Builder interface"
        className="rounded-xl"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Slug field">
    In the Page Settings panel, find the **Slug** field. You'll see the current URL (which may have numbers like `about-1755106901008`).

    </Frame>
    <Note>
      CoachIQ automatically adds numbers to prevent duplicate URLs, but you can customize these for better branding.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your custom slug">
    Delete the existing slug and type your preferred URL. Best practices:

    - Keep it short and descriptive: `about`, `training-programs`, `contact`
    - Use hyphens (not spaces): `basketball-training` not `basketball training`
    - Include keywords when relevant: `youth-basketball-camps`

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Match your slug to your page title for consistency and better SEO.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your changes">
    Click **Publish** to make your new URL live.

    <Check>
      Your page now has a clean, professional URL that's easy to share and remember.

## Removing auto-generated numbers

**Why numbers appear**: When you create pages with similar names, CoachIQ adds numbers to prevent URL conflicts.

**How to clean them up**:

1. Replace `about-1755106901008` with simply `about`
2. Change `training-programs-2` to `training-programs`
3. Update `contact-3` to `contact`

<Warning>
  **Important**: Don't use a slug that's already taken by another page. CoachIQ will show an error if there's a conflict.
</Warning>

## Best practices

<Tip>
  **Keep URLs short**: Aim for 2-4 words maximum for better user experience and sharing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use keywords**: Include relevant coaching terms that your clients might search for.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Stay consistent**: Use the same format across all pages (all lowercase, hyphens for spaces).
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to the old URL when I change the slug?">
    The old URL will no longer work. If you've shared links or have the page bookmarked, you'll need to update those with the new URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same slug on different pages?">
    No, each page must have a unique slug. CoachIQ will show an error if you try to use a duplicate slug.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do clean URLs help with sharing on social media?">
    Yes! Clean URLs like `yoursite.com/basketball-camps` look more professional when shared on Facebook, Instagram, or in text messages. They're also easier for parents to type and remember.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I include my sport in the URL?">
    Yes, if it's relevant. URLs like `/basketball-training` or `/soccer-camps` are more descriptive and SEO-friendly than generic terms like `/training` or `/camps`.
