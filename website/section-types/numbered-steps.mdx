## Customizing your numbered steps

### Adding content

<Steps>
<Step title="Set your section title">
Add a clear, action-oriented title that tells visitors what they'll accomplish:

**Good examples:**
- "Three Easy Steps to Get Started"
- "Your Path to Athletic Excellence"
- "How to Join Our Training Program"

**Avoid:**
- Vague titles like "Our Process" or "Steps"
- Overly long descriptions
</Step>

<Step title="Write compelling step headings">
Each step needs a clear, action-focused heading. Use active verbs and be specific:

**Good examples:**
- "Register Online"
- "Book Your Free Evaluation"
- "Start Training"

**Avoid:**
- Passive headings like "Registration" or "Training"
- Technical jargon your visitors won't understand
</Step>

<Step title="Add step descriptions">
Provide concise details for each step. Keep descriptions short (1-2 sentences) and focus on what the visitor needs to do and why it matters.

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: End each step description with what happens next or what the visitor gains by completing that step.
</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Styling your section

<Steps>
<Step title="Adjust background and colors">
Match your brand identity by customizing:
- Background color or image
- Text colors for readability
- Number badge styling

<Note>
Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for easy reading across all devices.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Customize icons and numbers">
Choose between:
- **Standard numbered badges** (1, 2, 3)
- **Custom icons** that represent each step
- **Mix of both** for visual variety

<Tip>
**Design tip**: Icons work great for process-based flows, while plain numbers are clearer for linear sequences.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Fine-tune spacing and alignment">
Adjust:
- Spacing between steps
- Section padding (top and bottom)
- Content alignment (left, center, or right)

This ensures your numbered steps section fits seamlessly with surrounding content.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Preview and publish

<Steps>
<Step title="Check mobile responsiveness">
Click the mobile preview icon to see how your numbered steps appear on phones and tablets.

<Warning>
**Important**: Numbered steps sections automatically stack vertically on mobile. Test to ensure your content remains readable.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Save and publish">
Once satisfied with your numbered steps section, click **Save** and then **Publish** to make it live on your website.

<Check>
Your numbered steps section is now guiding visitors through your coaching process!

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I add buttons or links within the steps?">
**Yes!** You can include call-to-action buttons after your numbered steps section or add links within the step descriptions to guide visitors to specific pages or booking forms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I use icons or numbers?">
**It depends on your content:**

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
