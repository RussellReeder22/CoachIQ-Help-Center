## What you'll accomplish

Build your coaching team by adding staff members, controlling which platform features they can access, and managing their roles as your business grows.

## Understanding staff roles

CoachIQ has two staff roles with different permission levels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Admin">
    **Full platform access** - No restrictions

    **What Admins can do:**

    - Access every page and feature
    - Manage staff (add, remove, change roles)
    - Configure all settings
    - View all financial data
    - Control page blocking for Coaches

    **When to use:**

    - Business owner (you)
    - Business manager or operations lead
    - Anyone who needs complete access

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Only assign Admin role to people you trust completely with financial access and business decisions.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Coach">
    **Restricted access based on page blocks**

    **What Coaches can do:**

    - Access coaching features (Schedule, People, Content)
    - Create schedulers and availability
    - Book and manage sessions
    - Message clients
    - View assigned athletes
    - **Limited by**: Page blocks set by Admin

    **When to use:**

    - Assistant coaches
    - Part-time trainers
    - Staff who only need session delivery access

    **Access badge:**

    - "Limited Access" = Coach with blocked pages
    - Can't see or use blocked features at all
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Adding staff members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Staff tab">
    From the People section, click the **Staff** tab at the top.

    <Note>
      The Staff tab is only visible to Admin users.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Staff">
    In the top-right corner, click the **\+ Add Staff** button.

    <Frame>
      ![Add Staff button in Staff tab](/images/staff-add-button.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter email address">
    Type the email address of the person you want to add and press Enter or click **Add Staff**.

    <Frame>
      ![Add Staff modal with email input](/images/staff-add-modal.png)
    </Frame>
    **What happens:**

    - Staff member is immediately added to your organization
    - They'll appear in both Staff tab AND Clients tab
    - Default role: **Coach** (with Limited Access)
    - No email is sent - you'll need to tell them they've been added
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tell them to log in">
    Inform your new staff member:

    "I've added you to our CoachIQ organization. Log in at **app.coachiq.io** with your email address. If you don't have a CoachIQ account, you'll be able to create one during login."

    When they log in, CoachIQ automatically connects them to your organization and gives them access based on their role.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing staff access (blocking pages)

Control which platform features ALL coaches can access with universal page blocking.

<Warning>
  **Important**: Page blocks apply to ALL coaches equally, not individual staff members. Admins always have full access regardless of blocks.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Staff Settings">
    From the Staff tab, click **⚙️ Manage Staff Access** in the top-right corner.

    <Frame>
      ![Manage Staff Access button](/images/staff-manage-access-button.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select pages to block">
    In the "Block Access" dropdown, select pages you want to hide from all coaches.

    **Available pages to block:**

    - Website & App
    - Inbox
    - Schedule - Calendar
    - Schedule - Schedulers
    - Payments - Products
    - Payments - Transactions
    - Payments - Subscriptions
    - Payments - Coupons
    - People - Clients
    - Content - Media
    - Content - Programs
    - Tools - Forms
    - Tools - Automations

    <Frame>
      ![Block Access dropdown showing available pages](/images/staff-block-access-dropdown.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Update Settings** to apply the blocks.

    **What coaches see:**

    - Blocked pages **completely disappear** from their navigation menu
    - No grayed-out items, no error messages - just hidden
    - They can only access pages you haven't blocked
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common blocking scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Starter Coach (Jake) - First Assistant">
    **Scenario**: Hiring first assistant coach who only delivers sessions

    **Block:**

    - ✅ Payments (all sections)
    - ✅ Tools - Automations
    - ✅ Website & App
    - ✅ Tools - Forms

    **Leave open:**

    - ✅ Schedule (Calendar & Schedulers)
    - ✅ People - Clients
    - ✅ Inbox
    - ✅ Content

    **Why**: Assistant can book sessions, message clients, and access training content, but can't see revenue or change business settings.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scaling Coach (Chris) - Multi-Coach Team">
    **Scenario**: 3 coaches with different specialties, want them focused on delivery

    **Block:**

    - ✅ Payments - Transactions
    - ✅ Payments - Subscriptions
    - ✅ Payments - Coupons
    - ✅ Tools - Automations
    - ✅ Website & App

    **Leave open:**

    - ✅ Schedule (full access for availability management)
    - ✅ People - Clients (view athlete details)
    - ✅ Inbox (client communication)
    - ✅ Content (program delivery)
    - ✅ Payments - Products (see pricing, but not revenue)

    **Why**: Coaches manage their own schedules and communicate with athletes, but don't see financial data or configure automations.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Facility Owner (Mike) - Tiered Staff">
    **Scenario**: Lead coaches need more access than assistant coaches

    **Option 1 - Make lead coaches Admins:**

    - Lead coaches = Admin role (full access)
    - Assistant coaches = Coach role with blocks

    **Option 2 - Use minimal blocks:**

    - Block only: Payments - Transactions, Payments - Subscriptions
    - Leave everything else open
    - Trust-based system for experienced staff

    **Why**: At scale, having trusted lead coaches with Admin access simplifies operations. Block only sensitive financial data.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Changing staff roles

Promote coaches to admins or demote admins to coaches as your team evolves.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the staff member">
    In the Staff tab, locate the person whose role you want to change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open their profile">
    Click on their card to open their full profile (same as client profiles).

    <Note>
      Staff members appear in both the Staff tab and Clients tab with identical profiles.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change role">
    In the **User Details** sidebar (right side), find the **Role** dropdown and change between:

    - Admin
    - Coach

    <Frame>
      ![Changing staff role in User Details](/images/staff-role-change.png)
    </Frame>
    **Effect is immediate:**

    - **Coach → Admin**: Gains full access, bypasses all page blocks, "Limited Access" badge removed
    - **Admin → Coach**: Subject to page blocks, "Limited Access" badge applied if blocks exist
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Be careful**: Changing someone to Admin gives them immediate access to all financial data, settings, and the ability to manage other staff.
</Warning>

## Staff profiles

Staff members have the same profile structure as clients with all the same tabs.

**What you can view:**

- **All Activity** - Everything they've done in the platform
- **Messages** - Conversation history
- **Bookings** - Sessions they're coaching or attending (if they also train)
- **Credits** - If they're both staff and a client
- **Products** - Purchases (if they're also a customer)
- **Transactions** - Revenue data (if applicable)
- **Family** - Linked family members
- **Media** - Content shared with them

<Tip>
  **Use case**: If a staff member is ALSO a client (e.g., a coach who also trains with you), they appear in both tabs and have activity in both capacities.
</Tip>

## Removing staff members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Clients tab">
    Go to People → **Clients** (not Staff tab).

    <Note>
      Staff members appear in both tabs, but deletion only works from Clients tab.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the staff member">
    Locate the person you want to remove using search or filters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open their profile and delete">
    Click on their card, then click the **Delete** button (typically in profile header or settings).

    **What happens:**

    - Removed from both Staff and Clients tabs
    - Loses access to your organization immediately
    - Cannot log in to your organization anymore
    - Their created content (schedulers, bookings, messages) remains
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Permanent action**: Deleting a staff member cannot be undone. If you want them back, you'll need to re-add them.
</Warning>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I give different coaches different permissions?">
    No - page blocks apply to ALL coaches universally. If you need different permission levels, promote trusted coaches to Admin or use a trust-based system where everyone has similar access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my coach already has a CoachIQ account?">
    No problem. When they log in, CoachIQ automatically connects them to your organization. They'll see your org in their account switcher (if they work for multiple orgs).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do staff members get notified when they're added?">
    No. CoachIQ doesn't send emails. You need to manually tell them they've been added and should log in at app.coachiq.io.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can coaches see the Staff tab and other staff members?">
    Only Admins can see the Staff tab. Coaches cannot view or manage other staff members.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to bookings when I remove a coach?">
    All past bookings remain intact with the coach's name attached. Future bookings assigned to that coach stay in the calendar. You'll need to manually reassign or cancel them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can someone be both staff AND a client?">
    Yes! If you add a staff member who also trains with you, they appear in both tabs and have activity in both capacities. This is common for assistant coaches who also participate in training.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many staff members can I add?">
    This depends on your CoachIQ plan. Check your billing settings or contact support for your specific limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I temporarily disable a staff member without deleting them?">
    No - there's no "deactivate" option. You must delete them to remove access. If they need temporary access removal, consider blocking all pages except one, but this affects ALL coaches.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips

**Start restrictive, then open up**: When hiring your first assistant coach, block most pages initially. As they prove themselves, gradually grant more access rather than taking access away later.

**Document your page blocks**: Keep a note of which pages you've blocked and why. This helps when onboarding new staff or troubleshooting access issues.

**Admin role for partners only**: Only make someone an Admin if they're a true business partner. Assistant coaches rarely need Admin access.

**Use role changes strategically**: Promote a coach to Admin temporarily if they need to handle something while you're away, then demote back to Coach after.

**Test their access**: After adding a new coach, ask them to log in while you're available to help troubleshoot any access questions.
