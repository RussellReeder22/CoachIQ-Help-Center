## What you'll accomplish

Learn how to create and apply tags to organize your clients, use filters to find exactly who you're looking for, and leverage tags for powerful group messaging and bulk operations.

---

## Why tags matter

Tags are your organizational superpower in CoachIQ. Without them, you're stuck scrolling through long client lists. With them, you can instantly filter to exactly who you need.

**Real-world examples:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Program Organization">
    **Problem**: You run 3 different training programs and need to see who's in each one.

    **Solution**: Tag clients by program:

    - "Elite Program"
    - "Beginner Group"
    - "Rising Stars"

    **Result**: Click a tag to see only those athletes. Message the entire group with one click.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Status Tracking">
    **Problem**: You can't tell who's a trial client vs. active member vs. past customer.

    **Solution**: Tag clients by status:

    - "Trial"
    - "Active Member"
    - "Monthly Subscription"
    - "Inactive"

    **Result**: Filter to "Trial" tag when running conversion campaigns. Track active membership counts instantly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Location Management">
    **Problem**: You train at multiple facilities and need to know who trains where.

    **Solution**: Tag clients by location:

    - "Downtown Facility"
    - "North Campus"
    - "Mobile Training"

    **Result**: Send facility-specific updates only to relevant athletes. Track attendance by location.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Segmentation">
    **Problem**: You need to track custom categories unique to your business.

    **Solution**: Create any tags that matter:

    - "Scholarship Athlete"
    - "Needs Equipment"
    - "Parent Email Only"
    - "Referred by Sarah"

    **Result**: Filter and message based on your specific business needs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Most coaches use 2-3 tags per client—typically a program/group tag, a status tag, and maybe a location tag. Don't overthink it. Start simple and add tags as needs emerge.
</Tip>

## Understanding the tag sidebar

When you're on the **People → Clients** page, the left sidebar shows all your tags:

<Frame>
  ![Tags Client Page Pn](/images/tags-client-page.png)
</Frame>

**What you see:**

| Element           | What it shows                    | How to use it                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **All tags**      | Every client, no filter          | Click to clear all tag filters |
| **Untagged**      | Clients with no tags assigned    | Find clients to organize       |
| **Custom tags**   | Your created tags (alphabetical) | Click to filter to that tag    |
| **\+ Create tag** | Add new tag                      | Create tags on-the-fly         |

**Tag count indicators**: Some tags show numbers like "Elite Program (24)" indicating how many clients have that tag.

<Note>
  **Tags are case-sensitive**: "Elite Program" and "elite program" are treated as different tags. Use consistent capitalization to avoid duplicates.
</Note>

---

## Creating tags

You can create tags in two ways: from the tag sidebar or while adding/editing clients.

### Method 1: Create from the sidebar

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click '+ Create tag'">
    In the tag sidebar on the Clients page, click the **\+ Create tag** button at the bottom.

    <Frame>
      ![Create Tag Pn](/images/create-tag.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your tag">
    Enter a descriptive tag name:

    **Good tag names:**

    - Specific: "Rising Stars Class" not just "Class"
    - Action-oriented: "Needs Follow-up" not "Follow-up"
    - Consistent: Decide on a naming convention (Title Case, sentence case, etc.)

    **Avoid:**

    - Generic terms: "Group", "Team" (too vague)
    - Numbers only: "1", "2" (not descriptive)
    - Special characters: Use letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens only
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and use">
    Press Enter or click Save.

    <Check>
      **Tag created!** It now appears in your tag sidebar, ready to be assigned to clients.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Create while tagging clients

Tags can also be created on-the-fly when adding or editing clients:

1. Open a client profile or click "New User"
2. In the **Tags** field, start typing a new tag name
3. If it doesn't exist, CoachIQ creates it automatically
4. Apply it to this client

<Tip>
  **Instant creation**: This method is faster when you're adding multiple clients with a new tag. Just type it once, and it's created and applied simultaneously.
</Tip>

---

## Applying tags to clients

Once tags exist, you can assign them to individual clients or in bulk.

### Tagging individual clients

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the client profile">
    From **People → Clients**, click the client's name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Tags field">
    In the **User Details** sidebar on the right, scroll to the **Tags** field.

    <Frame>
      ![Choose Tags Pn](/images/choose-tags.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add or remove tags">
    **To add a tag:**

    - Click into the Tags field
    - Start typing to search existing tags
    - Select from the dropdown or create a new tag
    - Tag applies immediately (auto-saves)

    **To remove a tag:**

    - Click the **×** icon next to the tag name
    - Tag is removed immediately

    <Note>
      **Multiple tags**: Clients can have unlimited tags. Apply as many as needed to organize effectively.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk tagging multiple clients

When you need to tag many clients at once (e.g., tagging an entire program cohort):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select multiple clients">
    On the **People → Clients** list page:

    1. Use checkboxes to select multiple clients
    2. Or use filters to narrow to a group, then "Select All"

    <Tip>
      **Keyboard shortcut**: Hold Shift and click to select a range of clients quickly.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply bulk action">
    Look for **Bulk Actions** or **Actions** dropdown (location varies by CoachIQ version):

    - Select "Add Tags" or "Manage Tags"
    - Choose the tag(s) to apply
    - Confirm

    <Check>
      **Done!** All selected clients now have the new tag. This works for hundreds of clients at once.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Removing tags in bulk**: Some bulk operations allow tag removal. Double-check your selection before removing tags from multiple clients—it's hard to undo if you select the wrong group.
</Warning>

---

## Using filters to find clients

Filters help you slice your client list in multiple ways: by role, by tag, or by search.

### Filter by role tabs

At the top of the Clients page, role tabs let you filter by user type:

<Frame>
  ![Select Filter Pn](/images/select-filter.png)
</Frame>

**Available role filters:**

- **All** - Everyone (no role filter)
- **Admins** - Users with admin permissions
- **Coaches** - Your coaching staff
- **Parents** - Guardians of youth athletes
- **Athletes** - People who train with you
- **Customers** - Anyone who has made a purchase

<Note>
  **Multiple roles**: A client tagged as both "Athlete" and "Customer" appears in both filter views. Role filters are not exclusive.
</Note>

### Filter by tags

Click any tag in the sidebar to filter the client list to only people with that tag:

**Single tag filter:**

1. Click a tag name in the sidebar
2. Client list updates to show only tagged clients
3. Tag name highlights to show active filter

**Multiple tag filters** (AND logic):

1. Click first tag (e.g., "Elite Program")
2. Click second tag (e.g., "Active Member")
3. Client list shows only clients with BOTH tags

**To clear tag filters**: Click "All tags" at the top of the sidebar.

<Tip>
  **Power combo**: Use role tabs + tag filters together. Example: Filter to "Athletes" tab, then click "Trial" tag to see only trial athletes (not trial parents or customers).
</Tip>

### Search for specific clients

The **Search people** bar at the top finds clients by name, email, or tag:

**To search:**

1. Click into the search bar
2. Type any part of:
   - First or last name
   - Email address
   - Tag name
3. Results filter as you type

**Search tips:**

- Searches are instant (no need to press Enter)
- Partial matches work ("sar" finds "Sarah" and "Sara")
- Case-insensitive
- Clear search to return to full list

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I search by phone number?">
    Not directly in the People search bar. Phone numbers aren't searchable from the Clients list.

    **Workaround**: If you need to find someone by phone, use the main CoachIQ search bar (top of dashboard) or export your client list and search in the spreadsheet.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I filter by date joined?">
    Not through the UI filters. The "Joined" column sorts chronologically, but there's no date range filter.

    **Workaround**: Click the "Joined" column header to sort by date (newest first or oldest first). Or export and filter in Excel/Google Sheets.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Combining filters for powerful segmentation

The real power comes from stacking filters to find exactly who you need:

**Example scenarios:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Find trial athletes ready to convert">
    **Goal**: Message all trial clients who have attended a  session

    **Filters to use:**

    1. Click **Athletes** role tab
    2. Click "Trial" or "Lead" tag in sidebar
    3. Manually review their Bookings tab for session count

    **Result**: Targeted list for conversion messaging
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Find inactive members">
    **Goal**: Re-engage members who haven't booked in 30 days

    **Filters to use:**

    1. Click "Inactive Member" tag
    2. Export the list
    4. Identify those without recent activity

    **Result**: Specific list for re-engagement campaigns
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Find athletes at specific location">
    **Goal**: Send facility closure notification to one location only

    **Filters to use:**

    1. Click **Athletes** role tab
    2. Click "Downtown Facility" tag

    **Result**: Targeted group for location-specific messaging
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Find untagged clients to organize">
    **Goal**: Clean up client list and ensure everyone is tagged

    **Filters to use:**

    1. Click **Untagged** in the sidebar

    **Result**: Every client without any tags. Go through and assign appropriate tags.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Save common filters as tags**: If you frequently need to find the same group, consider creating a specific tag for it. Example: Instead of filtering "Athletes" + "Elite Program" + "Active Member" every time, create a single "Elite Active" tag.
</Tip>

## Using tags for group messaging

One of the most powerful uses of tags is instant group messaging. Instead of selecting clients one-by-one, message everyone with a specific tag.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter to your target group">
    Use tag filters to narrow to the exact group you want to message:

    - Click the tag in the sidebar (e.g., "Rising Stars Class")
    - Verify the filtered list shows only your intended recipients
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Inbox">
    From the main navigation, click **Inbox** to open messaging.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select recipients by tag">
    When composing a new message:

    1. In the "To" field, select "Tags" option
    2. Choose the tag you filtered by (e.g., "Rising Stars Class")
    3. All clients with that tag are added as recipients

    <Frame>
      ![Messaging Tagged Users Pn](/images/messaging-tagged-users.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compose and send">
    Write your message and click Send.

    <Check>
      **Message sent!** Everyone with that tag receives your message (In-App, SMS, or both depending on your settings).
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Common messaging scenarios:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Program Announcements" icon="bullhorn">
    Message everyone in "Elite Program" about schedule changes, new content, or events
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trial Follow-ups" icon="user-clock">
    Send welcome series to all "Trial" tagged clients with onboarding resources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Payment Reminders" icon="credit-card">
    Message "Past Due" tagged clients about outstanding balances
  </Card>
  <Card title="Location Updates" icon="location-dot">
    Notify "Downtown Facility" clients about facility closure or equipment updates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Double-check before sending**: Once a group message is sent, you can't unsend it. Always verify your tag filter shows the correct group before messaging.
</Warning>

## Tag management best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="text">
    "Monthly Basketball Membership" is better than "BBall Monthly". Future-you (and your team) will understand it immediately.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Establish Naming Conventions" icon="list-check">
    Decide on Title Case, sentence case, or lowercase. Use consistently across all tags to avoid duplicates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean Up Regularly" icon="broom">
    Every quarter, review your tag list. Delete unused tags, merge duplicates (e.g., "trial" and "Trial"), rename unclear tags.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Tag Meanings" icon="file-lines">
    Keep a simple document explaining what each tag means and when to use it. Essential if multiple staff members tag clients.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit Tag Count" icon="minus-circle">
    Don't create 50 tags. Most coaches use 10-15 total. If you have too many, consider combining or using fewer tags more strategically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tag New Clients Immediately" icon="bolt">
    Make tagging part of your client creation workflow. Add at least 2 tags (program + status) when creating every new client.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common tag examples by business type

**Solo coach with 1 program:**

- "Active Member"
- "Trial"
- "Monthly Subscription"
- "Inactive"

**Multi-program facility:**

- "Youth Development"
- "Elite Training"
- "Adult Fitness"
- "Trial - Youth"
- "Trial - Elite"
- "Active Member"

**Multi-location operation:**

- "Location - Downtown"
- "Location - Westside"
- "Location - Mobile"
- "Elite Program"
- "Beginner Group"

- "Past Due"

**Seasonal training:**

- "Fall Season 2024"
- "Spring Season 2025"
- "Off-Season Training"
- "Camp Attendee"
- "Tournament Team"

<Tip>
  **Start with 5 tags**: Program/group, membership status, and maybe location. Add more only when you have a clear need. Over-tagging creates confusion.
</Tip>

## Exporting filtered lists

After filtering to a specific group, you can export just those clients:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply your filters">
    Use tag sidebar, role tabs, and search to narrow to your target group.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export button">
    In the top-right corner of the Clients page, click **Export**.

    <Frame>
      ![Export Clients Pn](/images/export-clients.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download and use">
    Download the CSV file containing only the filtered clients.

    **Export includes:**

    - Name (first and last)
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Role(s)
    - Tags
    - Join date
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Why export filtered lists:**

- Import into email marketing tools (Mailchimp, etc.)
- Share with external partners or sponsors
- Create custom reports in Excel/Google Sheets
- Backup specific segments

<Note>
  **Privacy reminder**: Exported client data contains personal information. Use it responsibly, comply with your privacy policy, and delete copies when no longer needed.
</Note>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can clients see what tags I've assigned them?">
    No. Tags are coach-side only. Clients never see tags in their Athlete Portal. Tags are purely for your internal organization and don't affect the client experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a tag?">
    When you delete a tag:

    - Historical messages sent to that tag remain (not deleted)
    - Clients aren't notified
    - You cannot undo the deletion

    **Recommendation**: Instead of deleting, consider renaming the tag if it's no longer relevant but has historical value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I rename a tag?">
    CoachIQ doesn't have a direct "rename tag" feature. Here's the workaround:

    1. Create the new tag with the desired name
    2. Filter to clients with the old tag
    3. Bulk add the new tag to all of them
    4. Bulk remove the old tag
    5. Delete the old tag

    It's manual but preserves client assignments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many tags can one client have?">
    Unlimited. There's no restriction on tags per client. Most coaches use 2-4 tags per client on average.

    **Practical limit**: If you're assigning 10+ tags to clients regularly, you probably have too many tags. Simplify your system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import tags with bulk client uploads?">
    Yes! When bulk importing clients via CSV, include a `tags` column with comma-separated tag names:

    ```
    first_name,last_name,email,tags
    Sarah,Johnson,sarah@email.com,"Elite Program, Active Member"
    ```

    Tags will be created automatically if they don't exist, and assigned to the imported clients.

    [Learn more about bulk import →](/people/adding-editing-clients#bulk-importing-from-a-spreadsheet)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do tags sync with the Athlete Portal?">
    No. Tags are coach-side organizational tools only. They don't appear in the athlete app/portal, affect what clients see, or change their experience in any way.

    **Exception**: Tags used for messaging determine who receives group messages, which indirectly affects the client experience.
  </Accordion>
