## What you'll accomplish

Learn how to add individual clients to CoachIQ, bulk import your entire roster from a spreadsheet, edit client details as information changes, and add custom fields to track what matters most to your business.

---

## When to add clients manually vs bulk import

Choose your method based on your situation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Entry (Best for...)">
    **Use the "New User" button when:**

    - Adding 1-5 clients at a time
    - Someone just signed up on your website
    - You're onboarding a trial client
    - You need immediate access to book them into a session
    - You want to assign specific tags and roles during creation

    **Advantage**: Full control, immediate profile creation, can add custom details right away
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bulk Import (Best for...)">
    **Use spreadsheet import when:**

    - Migrating from another platform (10+ clients)
    - Starting fresh with CoachIQ and have an existing roster
    - Adding an entire team or program cohort at once
    - You already maintain a spreadsheet of athletes

    **Advantage**: Add 100+ clients in seconds, no repetitive data entry, great for one-time migrations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Most coaches use manual entry for ongoing operations (new signups) and bulk import once during initial setup or when acquiring a new team/program.
</Tip>

## Adding clients manually

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'New User' button">
    From **People → Clients**, click the **New User** button in the top-right corner.

    <Frame>
      ![New User Pn](/images/new-user.png)
    </Frame>
    A form will appear with fields for client information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter required information">
    Fill in the essential fields:

    **Required fields:**

    - **First Name** - Client's first name
    - **Last Name** - Client's last name
    - **Email** - Primary email address (used for login and communications)
    - **Phone** - Mobile phone number for SMS (include country code)

    <Warning>
      **Email is critical**: This becomes their login credential for your Athlete Portal (mobile app/web). Use the email address they check regularly.
    </Warning>
    <Note>
      **Phone number format**: Use international format with country code, e.g., `+1 234 567 8900` for US numbers. This ensures SMS messages deliver correctly.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign role(s)">
    Select at least one role for this person:

    **Common role selections:**

    - **Athlete** - For anyone who trains with you (most common)
    - **Parent** - For guardians of youth athletes
    - **Coach** - If they also help deliver training (limited admin access)
    - **Admin** - Full platform access (use sparingly)

    <Tip>
      **Multiple roles**: You can select multiple roles. For example, a paying athlete who trains with you would be both "Athlete" and "Customer".
    </Tip>
    **What roles control:**

    - **App access**: Athletes/Parents see the athlete portal, Coaches/Admins see the coaching dashboard
    - **Permissions**: What they can view, book, and manage
    - **Filtering**: How they appear in your People list filters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add tags (optional but recommended)">
    Tags help you organize and filter clients. Add relevant tags during creation:

    **Examples:**

    - Program/group: "Elite Program", "Beginner Group", "Rising Stars"
    - Status: "Trial", "Active Member", "Monthly Subscription"
    - Location: "Downtown Facility", "North Campus"
    - Custom: Whatever makes sense for your business

    <Tip>
      **Don't overthink it**: You can always add or change tags later. Start simple with 2-3 tags like program name and membership status.
    </Tip>
    **To add a tag**: Type the tag name in the "Tags" field. If it doesn't exist yet, CoachIQ will create it automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and confirm">
    Click **Create** **New User** button.

    <Check>
      **Success!** The new client:

      - Appears immediately in your People → Clients list
      - Receives an email invitation to access your Athlete Portal
      - Can now be booked into sessions, assigned products, and messaged
    </Check>
    The client will receive an email with instructions to set their password and access your app/portal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bulk importing from a spreadsheet

When you need to add many clients at once, bulk import saves hours of manual data entry.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your spreadsheet">
    Create a CSV or Excel file with these columns (headers must match exactly):

    **Required columns:**

    - `first_name`
    - `last_name`
    - `email`
    - `phone`

    **Optional columns:**

    - `tags` (comma-separated, e.g., "Elite Program, Trial")
    - `role` (e.g., "athlete", "parent")

    **Example spreadsheet:**

    | first_name | last_name | email                                             | phone            | tags                  | role    |
    | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
    | Sarah      | Johnson   | [sarah.j@email.com](mailto:sarah.j@email.com)     | \+1 555 123 4567 | Elite Program, Active | athlete |
    | Mike       | Chen      | [mike.chen@email.com](mailto:mike.chen@email.com) | \+1 555 234 5678 | Beginner Group        | athlete |

    <Warning>
      **Clean your data first**:

      - Remove duplicate email addresses (imports will fail for duplicates)
      - Verify phone numbers include country codes
      - Check for typos in email addresses
      - Ensure consistent tag naming (case-sensitive)
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access import feature">
    From **People → Clients**, look for the **Import** button or navigate to **Settings → Import & Export → Import Athletes**.

    <Note>
      **Location varies**: Some CoachIQ accounts have the import button directly in the People section, others access it through Settings. Check both locations.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload and map fields">
    1. Upload your CSV or Excel file
    2. Map your spreadsheet columns to CoachIQ fields
    3. Preview the first few rows to verify correct mapping
    4. Choose whether to send invitation emails (recommended: No for bulk imports, send manually later)

    <Tip>
      **Test with 5 clients first**: Upload a small test file with 5 clients to verify your format works before importing your entire roster.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and import">
    CoachIQ will show:

    - How many clients will be imported
    - Any errors or duplicates detected
    - Which fields are missing

    Click **Import** to process.

    <Check>
      **Import complete!** Your clients now appear in the People list. You can filter by the tags you imported to verify everything processed correctly.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow up after import">
    After bulk importing:

    1. **Verify the import**: Filter by imported tags to check client count
    2. **Send welcome messages**: Use Inbox to send a group message to all imported clients
    3. **Provide login instructions**: Send app download links and first-time login guidance
    4. **Assign products/programs**: If they should have access to content or credits, add those next

    <Tip>
      **Welcome automation**: Consider setting up an automation (Tools → Automations) that triggers when "New User" is created to send welcome messages automatically.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing client information

Client details change—email addresses, phone numbers, roles, tags. Here's how to keep information current:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the client profile">
    From **People → Clients**, click the client's name to open their full profile.

    <Frame>
      ![Profile View Default Pn](/images/profile-view-default.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the User Details sidebar">
    On the right side of the profile, you'll see the **User Details** panel with:

    - Role dropdown
    - First name field
    - Last name field
    - Email field
    - Phone number field
    - **\+ Add Field** button (for custom fields)

    **To edit**: Click into any field, make your change, and it saves automatically.

    <Warning>
      **Changing email addresses**: If you change someone's email, they'll need to use the NEW email to log in. Notify them immediately to avoid confusion.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update role or tags">
    **To change roles:**

    1. Click the **Role** dropdown in User Details
    2. Select/deselect roles as needed
    3. Changes save automatically

    **To update tags:**

    1. Scroll to the Tags field in User Details
    2. Add or remove tags (type to search existing tags)
    3. Changes save immediately

    <Note>
      **Bulk tag updates**: To change tags for multiple clients at once, use the Clients list view—select multiple clients, then use bulk actions to add/remove tags. Details in [Organizing Clients with Tags & Filters](/people/tags-filters).
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Adding custom fields

Beyond the standard fields (name, email, phone), you can track custom information specific to your business.

**Common custom field examples:**

- Emergency contact name/phone
- School or team affiliation
- Jersey number
- Graduation year
- Parent's work phone
- Medical conditions or allergies
- Referral source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click '+ Add Field'">
    In the User Details sidebar of any client profile, click **\+ Add Field** at the bottom.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and populate the field">
    1. Enter a field name (e.g., "Emergency Contact")
    2. Enter the value for this specific client
    3. Click save

    <Tip>
      **Custom fields are global**: Once you create a custom field for one client, it becomes available for ALL clients. You don't have to fill it in for everyone—only for those where it's relevant.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use custom fields for filtering">
    After creating custom fields, you can:

    - View them in the User Details sidebar for each client
    - Edit values at any time
    - Use them for reporting or segmentation

    <Note>
      **Limitation**: Custom fields appear in client profiles but aren't currently available as filter options in the main Clients list. Use tags for filterable organization.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting client data

Need your client list in a spreadsheet? Use the export feature for backups, external tools, or reporting.

**To export:**

1. Go to **People → Clients**
2. Apply any filters (optional—export only filtered results)
3. Click **Export** button (top right)
4. Download the CSV file

**What's included in the export:**

- Name (first and last)
- Email address
- Phone number
- Role(s)
- Tags
- Join date
- Custom field values

<Warning>
  **Privacy reminder**: Exported files contain personal information. Store securely, share only when necessary, and delete copies when no longer needed. Comply with your privacy policy and applicable regulations.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Regular backups**: Consider exporting your full client list monthly as a backup. Store securely with your other business records.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens after I add a new client?">
    Immediately after creation:

    1. Client appears in your People → Clients list
    2. They receive an email invitation to access your Athlete Portal
    3. You can now book them into sessions, message them, and assign products
    4. They can download your mobile app or access the web portal using the email you entered

    **Email invitation**: Contains a link to set their password and get started. If they don't see it, check spam folders or resend from their profile.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add a client without an email address?">
    No—email is required because it serves as their login credential for your Athlete Portal.

    **Workarounds for special cases:**

    - **Youth athletes without email**: Use a parent's email and set Role as "Parent", then link the child later
    - **Team accounts**: Create a temporary email (e.g., `team-placeholder@yourfacility.com`) but you'll need to update it later for them to access the portal

    <Tip>
      **Best practice**: Always use real, working email addresses. It ensures clients can log in, receive booking confirmations, and get messages.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I import duplicate clients?">
    CoachIQ checks for duplicate email addresses during import. If a duplicate is detected:

    - That row is skipped (not imported)
    - You'll see an error message identifying the duplicate
    - Other non-duplicate clients in the file still import successfully

    **To fix**: Remove duplicate emails from your spreadsheet and re-import just those clients, or manually add them one by one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can clients edit their own information?">
    Yes, partially. Clients can update their own:

    - Name
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Password
    - Profile photo

    They access these settings through the Athlete Portal (mobile app or web) under their account settings.

    **You control**: Roles, tags, credits, product assignments, and custom fields—clients cannot change these.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I delete a client?">
    From the client's profile, click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the top-right corner near "Message" and "Book" buttons.

    **What happens:**

    - Client is removed from your People list
    - They lose access to your Athlete Portal immediately
    - Historical data (past bookings, transactions, messages) is preserved for your records
    - They will NOT be charged for any upcoming subscriptions

    <Warning>
      **This cannot be undone easily**. Consider using an "Inactive" tag instead if they might return or you want to preserve their active status.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change someone from Client to Staff?">
    Yes! Roles can be changed at any time:

    1. Open their profile (People → Clients or Staff)
    2. In the User Details sidebar, update the **Role** dropdown
    3. Changes save automatically

    **Example**: An athlete who starts coaching for you can have both "Athlete" and "Coach" roles. They'll see the coaching dashboard AND their own athlete profile.
  </Accordion>

## Pro tips for client management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tag During Creation" icon="tags">
    Always add at least 2 tags when creating clients: their program/group and their status (Trial, Member, etc.). Makes filtering and messaging much easier later.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify Contact Info" icon="check">
    Double-check email and phone before saving. Typos in email = client can't log in. Wrong phone = SMS won't deliver.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Consistent Naming" icon="font">
    Decide on a format for names (First Last, or Nickname Full Last) and stick to it. Makes your client list clean and searchable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add Notes Immediately" icon="pen">
    Right after creating a client, open their profile and add a comment in their Activity with context: how you met, what they're training for, referral source. Future-you will thank you.
