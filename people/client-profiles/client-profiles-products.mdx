## Manually adding products

Give a client access to a product without them paying:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click + Add Product">
    Top-right corner of the Products tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for product">
    Type product name in the search bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select product">
    Click the product you want to grant them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Client now has access to that product (appears in their Products tab).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **No payment collected** when you manually add products. Use this for:

  - Complimentary memberships
  - Staff/family member access
  - Makeup sessions after issues
  - Trial period access
</Note>

## Common uses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What memberships do they have?">
    1. Click **Subscriptions** filter tab
    2. Look for products with "Active" status
    3. Check amount to see monthly billing

    **Example**: "Hybrid Rising Stars/Elite 5 Credit Package - $125.00/month" = They're paying $125/month for this membership.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Did they buy the trial session?">
    1. Click **One-Time Payment** filter tab
    2. Look for trial product name (e.g., "Elite Class Trial Session")
    3. Check date created to see when

    **Use case**: Converting trials to paid members—see if they bought trial, then check Subscriptions to see if they upgraded.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Giving them free access to a new program">
    1. Click **\+ Add Product**
    2. Search for the program product
    3. Select and confirm

    **They now have access** in their Athlete Portal without paying. Useful for beta testing or VIP perks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many times have they purchased this?">
    Look at the **purchase count indicator** (●):

    - ● 1 = Purchased once
    - ● 2 = Purchased twice (or resubscribed)

    Rare to see more than 1 for subscriptions (they just renew), common for one-time products (repeat buyers).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What you CAN'T do here

The Products tab is primarily **view-only**. To take action:

| Action Needed            | Where to Do It                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Cancel subscription**  | Stripe                               |
| **Refund purchase**      | Stripe                               |
| **Change product price** | Payments → Products → Edit product   |
| **See payment history**  | Transactions tab (financial details) |

<Note>
  Think of Products tab as **"What they own"**, not **"How they paid"**. For payment details, use Transactions tab.
</Note>

---

## Empty products tab?

If you see no products, this client has:

- Never purchased anything
- Only booked free sessions (no paid products)
- Paid for sessions directly without products

**Next step**: Either:

- Manually add a product to give them access
- Wait until they purchase something through checkout
- Check if they're using a different account (Family tab)

---

## Pro tips

**Recent sort default**: Products tab sorts by "Date Created" newest first. If looking for something from a year ago, scroll or use search.

**Product vs Transaction difference**:

- **Products tab** = What they have access to
- **Transactions tab** = Financial record of payments

A client can have a product (manual grant) without a transaction (no payment).

**Access Codes rare?** Most coaches don't use Access Codes unless they're selling digital-only content. It's okay if you never see this type.
