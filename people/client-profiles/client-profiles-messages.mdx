## When to use Messages tab vs Inbox

| Use Messages Tab When...                     | Use Inbox When...                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| You're already in client profile             | You need to message multiple clients     |
| You want to see ONLY this client's history   | You want to see all conversations        |
| You need context from their bookings/credits | You're managing daily communication flow |

**Pro tip**: Most coaches use the profile Message button (top-right header) to start a conversation, then continue in Inbox if needed.

## Common uses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick check: Did they see my message?">
    Scroll to your last message. If you see their reply below it with a timestamp, they saw it.

    **No reply indicator** in CoachIQ—just look for their response timestamp.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Finding what you discussed about payment">
    1. Toggle to **In-App** or **SMS** depending on where you messaged them
    2. Scroll through conversation (use date dividers to navigate)
    3. Look for messages around transaction dates

    Faster than searching Inbox if you know it's this specific client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sending a booking reminder with context">
    While looking at their **Bookings** tab, notice they have a session tomorrow. Switch to **Messages** tab and send:

    "Hey! Excited to see you tomorrow at 3 PM for Rising Stars Class. Bring your gear!"

    Context from their profile makes messaging more personal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Image attachments

**Viewing images:**

- Click image to view full size
- Useful for: Form photos, workout videos, injury documentation

**Sending images:**

- Click **\+** icon in message input

The Messages tab shows **only conversations**. It does NOT show:
