## Checking current balance

**Quick balance check:**

1. Click the credit tab you want (Master Credits, or a specific product)
2. Look at the **top of the transaction list**—most recent transaction shows running balance
3. Add up green (+) and red (-) entries if you need to verify

<Tip>
  **Fastest way**: Look at the top entry amount. That's usually their current balance unless they just booked something.
</Tip>

## Common uses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do they have enough credits for today's session?">
    1. Click appropriate credit tab (Master or product-specific)
    2. Check most recent balance
    3. If balance ≥ 1, they can book

    **Takes 3 seconds** from their profile.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did their credits disappear?">
    Look for **Expiration** entries in red:

    - Check **Source** column—which product expired?
    - Check **Info** column—shows expiration date
    - Scroll up to see when credits were originally purchased

    **Common scenario**: Client bought a 10-pack in January with 90-day expiration, used 3 credits, then 7 expired in April.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="They claim they never used a credit—verify it">
    1. Go to **Logs** tab (shows all credit types)
    2. Filter mentally or scroll to find **Redeemed** entries
    3. Check **Source** column—shows which session
    4. Cross-reference with **Bookings** tab to confirm attendance

    **Proof**: "You redeemed a credit on Oct 16 for Rising Stars Class at 10:34 AM."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manually adding credits (makeup, promotion, gift)">
    **You can't do it from this tab.** To manually add credits:

    2. Find client, add credits
    3. Return to profile Credits tab to see "Set by [Your Name]" entry

## Master Credits vs Product Credits

**Master Credits**:

- Work for ANY scheduler you create
- Most flexible
- Typically sold as "10-Pack Universal Credits"

**Product-Specific Credits** (e.g., "Elite Class 5-Pack"):

- ONLY work for schedulers linked to that product
- Useful for tiered membership levels
- Client might have Master Credits AND Elite Credits separately

<Warning>
  **Redemption priority**: When a client books, CoachIQ uses product-specific credits first (if available), then falls back to Master Credits. You can't control this order.
</Warning>

---

## Empty credits tab?

If you see no transactions, this client has:

- Never purchased credits
- Never been manually granted credits
- Only paid cash/card for sessions (not credit-based)

**Next step**: Sell them a credit package or manually grant trial credits to get started.

---

## Pro tips

**Watch for expiration dates in "Info" column**: If you see credits expiring soon, send a reminder: "Hey! You have 5 credits expiring on 10/18. Book your sessions before they're gone!"

**"Unknown" source usually means**: Old data before CoachIQ tracked sources, or credits from a deleted product. Not a problem—credits still work.

**Negative balances are impossible**: If balance hits zero, client can't book credit-based sessions. They'll need to purchase more credits or pay directly.

**Sort mentally by date**: Newest entries at top. Scroll down to see historical patterns (e.g., "They used to buy credits monthly, but stopped 3 months ago").
