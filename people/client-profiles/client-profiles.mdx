## Understanding the profile header

At the top of every client profile, you'll see key information and quick action buttons:

<Frame>
  ![Client Example Pn](/images/client-example.png)
</Frame>

**Profile header includes:**

| Element            | What it shows                    | How to use it                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Profile photo**  | Client's avatar or initials      | Click to upload/change photo             |
| **Name**           | Full name and role badges        | Edit in User Details sidebar             |
| **Last seen**      | When they last accessed your app | Helps gauge engagement                   |
| **Message button** | Opens conversation               | Starts or continues chat in Inbox        |
| **Book button**    | Manual booking                   | Quickly book them into a session         |
| **Delete button**  | Remove client                    | Use with caution—cannot be easily undone |

<Tip>
  **Quick actions save time**: Instead of navigating to Calendar or Inbox, use the **Book** and **Message** buttons right from the profile to take immediate action.
</Tip>

**What you can edit here:**

- **Role** (dropdown: Athlete, Coach, Admin, Parent, Customer)

- **Last name**
- **Email** (their login credential)
- **Phone** (for SMS messaging)
- **Custom fields** (click **\+ Add Field** for custom tracking)

<Note>
  **Changes save automatically**: Click into any field, make your edit, and it saves immediately. No separate "Save" button needed.
</Note>

**Learn more**: See [Adding & Editing Client Information](/people/adding-editing-clients) for detailed editing instructions.

## The 9 activity tabs explained

The client profile organizes all information into tabs. Each tab answers a specific question about your relationship with this client.

## How to use profiles effectively

The client profile is your command center for answering common questions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='"When was their last session?"'>
    **Go to: Bookings tab**

    Filter by "Past" to see completed sessions in reverse chronological order. The most recent session appears first.

    Faster shortcut: Check the "All Activity" tab—sessions appear in the unified timeline with timestamps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='"How many credits do they have left?"'>
    **Go to: Credits tab**

    Look at the tab badges at the top:

    - **Logs** tab = Complete transaction history
    - **Master Credits** tab = Universal credits (work for any scheduler)
    - **[Product Name]** tabs = Credits from specific packages/subscriptions

    Each tab shows the current balance prominently at the top.

    [Learn more about credit notation →](/people/client-profiles/credits)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='"Are they still on the monthly membership?"'>
    **Go to: Subscriptions tab**

    Check the status badge:

    - **Green "Active"** = Currently subscribed and billing normally
    - **Yellow "Past Due"** = Payment failed, needs attention
    - **Gray "Canceled"** = No longer subscribing

    The summary at the top shows total active subscriptions and monthly recurring revenue from this client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='"What have they purchased?"'>
    **Go to: Products tab**

    See everything they've ever bought: one-time products, credit packages, subscriptions, access codes. Filter by product type to narrow results.

    For dollar amounts and payment status, switch to the **Transactions** tab.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='"Did they get my message?"'>
    **Go to: Messages tab**

    View the conversation thread. Toggle between **In-App** (messages sent through your portal/app) and **SMS** (text messages) using the tabs.

    Timestamps show when messages were sent. Look for their replies to confirm they saw your message.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick navigation between clients

When reviewing multiple client profiles, use these shortcuts to move quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the back arrow">
    Click the **← back arrow** in the top-left to return to the Clients list without losing your place or filters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open in new tab">
    **Right-click** (or Cmd+Click on Mac) a client name from the Clients list to open their profile in a new browser tab. Great for comparing multiple clients side-by-side.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search from anywhere">
    Use the global search bar to jump directly to any client by typing their name, even when you're deep in another section of CoachIQ.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Browser bookmarks**: Bookmark frequently-accessed client profiles (your top athletes, VIP clients, etc.) for instant access. Each profile has a unique URL you can save.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can clients see their own profile like I can?">
    No. Clients see a simplified version through the Athlete Portal (mobile app or web) that shows:

    - Their own bookings and schedule
    - Their credit balance
    - Programs and content you've shared with them
    - Their subscription status
    - Their messages with you

    They **cannot** see transaction history, all activity timeline, or the detailed information you see in the coaching dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see any data in some tabs?">
    Tabs only populate with data after activity occurs:

    - **Bookings**: Empty until they book or you book them into a session
    - **Credits**: Empty until they purchase a credit package or you manually grant credits
    - **Products**: Empty until they make a purchase
    - **Transactions**: Empty until they complete a payment
    - **Subscriptions**: Empty until they sign up for recurring billing
    - **Family**: Empty until you link family members
    - **Media**: Empty until you assign programs or lessons

    **All Activity** will always have at least one entry: their account creation date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I export a single client's complete history?">
    Not directly from the profile, but you can:

    1. **Bookings**: Filter the main Calendar by this client's name, then export
    2. **Transactions**: Use Payments → Transactions, filter by client name, export
    3. **Full profile**: Take screenshots of each tab for records (useful for disputes or documentation)

    For regular reporting, consider using the main section exports (Calendar, Transactions, etc.) filtered by client name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to the profile if I delete the client?">
    When you delete a client:

    - Their profile is removed from the Clients list
    - They lose access to your Athlete Portal immediately
    - **Historical data is preserved** in your system for record-keeping
    - Past bookings still show in Calendar (marked with deleted client's name)
    - Past transactions remain in payment history
    - Messages remain in Inbox

    **Important**: You cannot restore a deleted profile easily. Use an "Inactive" tag instead if they might return.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I print a client profile?">
    **To print or save as PDF:**

    1. Open the client profile
    2. Navigate to the tab you want to print (e.g., Bookings, Transactions)
    3. Use your browser's print function (Cmd+P on Mac, Ctrl+P on Windows)
    4. Select "Save as PDF" as the destination

    **Tip**: Print the "All Activity" tab for a comprehensive timeline record, or print specific tabs (Credits, Transactions) for detailed financial records.
  </Accordion>
