<Info>
  **Where to find this**: Client Profile → **All Activity** tab (selected by default)
</Info>

## What it shows

The All Activity feed is your **unified timeline** of everything this client has done:

- 📅 **Bookings** - Sessions booked, attended, or canceled
- 💳 **Purchases** - Products bought (one-time, subscriptions, credits)
- 📝 **Form submissions** - Onboarding forms, waivers, feedback
- 🎓 **Program enrollments** - Courses or programs they've joined
- 💬 **Messages** - Communication sent and received
- 💰 **Credit transactions** - Credits purchased, redeemed, expired
- 🔄 **Subscription changes** - Membership started, canceled, renewed
- 🏷️ **Profile updates** - Tags added, role changes, info edits

**Default view**: Newest activity first (reverse chronological)

---

## Using the filter tabs

Narrow the timeline to show only specific activity types:

<Frame>
  ![All Activity Pn](/images/all-activity.png)
</Frame>

| Filter Tab   | What it shows                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **All**      | Everything in one timeline (default) |
| **Forms**    | Only form submissions                |
| **Orders**   | Only purchases and transactions      |
| **Programs** | Only program enrollments             |
| **Calendar** | Only bookings and sessions           |

<Tip>
  **Quick scan tip**: Use "All" for the complete picture, then switch to specific tabs (like "Calendar") when you need to focus on just bookings or purchases.
</Tip>

## Common uses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick health check on a client">
    Scroll the All Activity feed to see:

    - Are they booking regularly? (recent bookings)
    - Have they purchased anything? (credit packages, memberships)
    - When did they last engage? (most recent activity)

    **Takes 10 seconds** to assess client engagement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Finding a specific booking">
    1. Click **Calendar** filter tab
    2. Scroll to find the booking date
    3. Click **"View Calendar →"** to see full booking details

    Faster than searching through the main Calendar if you know it's this client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verifying a purchase">
    1. Click **Orders** filter tab
    2. Look for the transaction with amount and date
    3. Click the entry to see full transaction details

    Useful when a client says "I bought a package" and you need proof.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checking message history quickly">
    Scroll All Activity to see when messages were sent/received. For full conversation, click **Messages** tab.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What's NOT in All Activity

The feed focuses on **client actions** and **your interactions with them**. It does NOT show:

- Your internal notes about them
- Calendar changes you made (unless it's booking/canceling)
- Tag changes you made
- Email opens/clicks (Inbox handles that)

For comprehensive details, use the specific tabs (Credits, Transactions, etc.).

## Pro tips

**Spot engagement patterns**: Regular bookings every week + recent purchases = engaged client. No bookings in 30+ days = potential churn risk.

**Time stamps matter**: "2w 3d" means 2 weeks, 3 days ago. Use these to gauge recency without doing date math.

**"View Calendar" shortcut**: Don't navigate away—click "View Calendar →" on any booking to jump straight to that session in your Calendar.

**Empty feed?** If you see nothing, this is either a brand-new client with no activity yet, or filters are hiding everything. Click "All" to reset.
