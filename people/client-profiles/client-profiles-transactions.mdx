| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **All**      | Every transaction (default)               |

## Understanding "Source" column

**Common sources you'll see:**

- **Admin** - You manually charged them or added product
- **Subscription product name** - Auto-charged from recurring billing
- **Product name** - One-time purchase they made through checkout
- **"Unknown"** - Old transaction before source tracking existed

---

## Pro tips

**Failed payment patterns**: If you see multiple "Past Due" entries over time, this client has chronic payment issues. Consider switching them to manual billing or requiring payment upfront.

**Export for accounting**: While you can't export from the profile, you CAN export from main Payments → Transactions section and filter by this client's email.

**Time filters are powerful**: Use "7 Days" to see just this week's activity, helpful for weekly revenue reviews.

**Empty isn't bad**: Some of your best clients might have \$0 in transactions if you manually granted them free access (staff, family, ambassadors).
