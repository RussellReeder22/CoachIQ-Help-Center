    **Includes:**

    - Original booking date
    - Session name
    - When it was canceled

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Past">
    Completed sessions (attendance history).

## Time zone selector

**Top-right dropdown** lets you view bookings in different time zones:

- **PST** (Pacific)
- **EST** (Eastern)
- **CST** (Central)
- **MST** (Mountain)
- And more...

<Tip>
  **Why this matters**: If your client travels or you work with athletes in different states, toggle their time zone to confirm "Yes, 3 PM your time, not mine."
</Tip>

## What you CAN'T do here

The Bookings tab is **view-only**. To take action:

| Action Needed          | Where to Do It                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cancel a booking**   | Go to Calendar → Find session → Cancel             |
| **Reschedule**         | Cancel in Calendar, then book new time             |
| **Book a new session** | Click **Book** button (top-right of profile)       |
| **Refund credits**     | Go to Calendar → Cancel session with refund option |

<Note>
  Think of Bookings tab as your **history log**, not your booking tool.
</Note>

## Empty bookings tab?

If you see no bookings, this client has either:

- Never booked a session (brand new)
- Only booked sessions you later deleted from Calendar
- Booked through a different account (check Family tab for linked accounts)

**Next step**: Click **Book** button to manually schedule their first session.

---

## Pro tip: Spot no-show patterns

If you see:

- Many **Canceled** entries (especially last-minute)
- Long gaps between **Past** bookings
- Sessions booked but zero in **Past** tab

This signals engagement issues. Address it:

1. Check **Messages** tab—did they communicate?
2. Look at **Credits** tab—do they have credits expiring?
3. Send a check-in: "Hey, missed you lately! Everything okay?"
