## Common uses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are they still a paying member?">
    1. Look at **Active** count in summary (top)
    2. If **Active = 1** (or more), yes they're subscribed
    3. If **Active = 0**, check **Canceled** tab to see when they left

    **Takes 2 seconds** to verify membership status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much recurring revenue from this client?">
    Look at **Monthly Revenue** in the summary (top).

    **Example**: "\$0" in the screenshot means no active subscriptions currently (or using different billing).

    **Use case**: If Monthly Revenue = $125, this client contributes $1,500/year to your recurring revenue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did their subscription cancel?">
    1. Click **Canceled** status filter
    2. Find the subscription entry
    3. Check the date it canceled

    **Common reasons** (not shown in tab, but good to know):

    - Client canceled through their Portal
    - Payment failed too many times (auto-canceled)
    - You manually canceled it

    **Next step**: Check Messages tab to see if they communicated why, or reach out.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When does their trial end?">
    1. Click **Trialing** status filter
    2. Check subscription date
    3. Look at product details to see trial length

    **Pro tip**: Message them 2 days before trial ends: "Hey! Your trial ends in 2 days. You'll be charged \$125 unless you cancel. Let me know if you have questions!"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manually canceling their subscription">
    **You can't do it from this tab.** To cancel:

    1. Go to main **Payments** → **Subscriptions**
    2. Find this client's subscription
    3. Click cancel button

    Or navigate to their subscription management in their Portal settings.

## What you CAN'T do here

Subscriptions tab is **view-only**. To take action:

| Action Needed                 | Where to Do It                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Cancel subscription**       | Payments → Subscriptions → Cancel        |
| **Change subscription price** | Payments → Products → Edit product       |
| **Retry failed payment**      | Payments → Subscriptions → Retry billing |
| **Refund past charges**       | Transactions tab → Refund                |

## Empty subscriptions tab?

If you see no subscriptions, this client:

- Has never subscribed to a membership
- Only makes one-time purchases
- Uses credit packages instead of recurring billing
- Is on a free/complimentary plan

**Next step**: Sell them on a subscription if recurring revenue is your goal.

## Pro tips

**Watch "Past Due" closely**: These are at-risk members. Reach out within 24 hours of seeing this status. Most failed payments are accidental (expired card, insufficient funds) and easily fixable.

**\$0 Monthly Revenue ≠ Not valuable**: Some clients buy large credit packs upfront instead of subscriptions. Check Transactions tab for their lifetime value.

**Canceled ≠ Gone forever**: Many clients cancel, take a break, then re-subscribe. Keep them on your email list and reach out quarterly with offers.

**Multiple active subscriptions?** Some clients have both a base membership AND add-on subscriptions (e.g., "Monthly Membership" + "Private Training Add-On"). Active count shows total.

**Source = "Admin" means**: You manually added them to the subscription (no checkout). Common for staff, comp memberships, or special arrangements.
