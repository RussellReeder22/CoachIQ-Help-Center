</Info>

## Filter by content tags

**Left sidebar** shows all content tags you've created:

- Click any tag to show only content with that tag
- **"All tags"** = show everything (default)
- **"Untagged"** = content without any tags

**Example tags** (from screenshot):
- 10 principles
- Habits
- Staff Portrait
- Train Like a Pro
- 32 Days of Handles
- Finishing Tutorials
- And many more...

<Tip>
**Organization tip**: If you use tags consistently when creating content, filtering becomes super powerful. Tag content like "Beginner Fundamentals" or "Advanced Shooting" to show clients exactly what they need.
</Tip>

## View toggles

**Top-right icons** let you switch display modes:

| Icon | View Type | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **☰ List** | Vertical list with details | Default view, shows names clearly |
| **⊞ Grid** | Thumbnail cards | Visual browsing, see thumbnails |

<Note>
Grid view is better for **video-heavy content** where thumbnails help identify content. List view is better for **program names** and quick scanning.
</Note>

## Common uses

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What programs have I assigned to them?">
1. Look at the Media tab (no filters needed)
2. Scan the list for program names
3. Count how many programs they have access to

**Use case**: Before a session, check what content they should've watched: "Hey, did you finish the '10 principles' program I shared?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Show me only shooting drills I shared">
1. Click **"Shooting"** tag in left sidebar (if you have this tag)
2. View only shooting-related content

**Filter multiple tags?** Click one tag at a time to switch filters. No multi-select currently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Did I already share the finishing tutorials?">
1. Search visually through the list, OR
2. Click **"Finishing Tutorials"** tag if you tagged it

**Quick verification** before messaging: "Just wanted to confirm—you should see 'Finishing Tutorials' in your app now."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="They can't find content in their Portal">
**Troubleshooting checklist:**
1. Go to their Media tab
2. Check if content appears here
3. If YES, it's assigned → problem is on their end (app refresh needed)
4. If NO, it's not assigned → go to Content section and assign it

**Common issue**: Content is published but not assigned to their account or program.
</Accordion>

## Empty media tab?

If you see no content, you haven't assigned any programs, lessons, or media to this client yet.

**To assign content:**
1. Go to **Content** → **Programs** or **Media**
2. Open the program/lesson you want to share
3. Add this client to the "Shared with" list
4. Return to their profile—content now appears in Media tab

## Understanding content types

| Content Type | What it is | Where you create it |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Programs** | Multi-lesson courses with structure | Content → Programs |
| **Lessons** | Individual training videos | Content → Lessons |
| **Video Analysis** | Recorded sessions with markup | Content → Video Analysis |
| **Media Files** | Raw videos/images uploaded | Content → Media Hub |

**In the client's Portal**: They see programs as organized courses. Programs contain lessons. Media files appear as standalone content.

## Pro tips

**Tag everything**: The more consistently you tag content, the more useful this filter becomes. Create tags like "Warm-up", "Drills", "Game Film", "Homework" and use them religiously.

**Use this for check-ins**: Before a session, pull up their Media tab and ask: "Did you watch the 3 videos I shared?" Now you can actually see which 3 videos you're referring to.

**Grid view for visual clients**: Some clients respond better to thumbnails. Show them their Media tab in grid view during sessions: "See these 6 videos? That's your homework for next week."

**Content visibility ≠ completion**: Just because content appears in their Media tab doesn't mean they watched it. You'll need to ask or check engagement analytics (if available).

**Search bar exists**: Use the **"Search media hub"** bar to find specific content by name rather than scrolling.
