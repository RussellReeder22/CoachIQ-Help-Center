## How attachments appear to athletes

### In-App and web viewing

Attachments display as styled, clickable elements that match your branding:

- **Clean design**: Professional card-style links with clear labels
- **Action-oriented**: Clear indicators of what happens when clicked
- **Price display**: Products may show pricing depending on context
- **Smooth transitions**: Opens in web browser or new tab seamlessly

<Frame>
  ![Inbox Attachment View Pn](/images/inbox-attachment-view.png)
</Frame>

<Note>
  When athletes using the mobile app click an attachment, it opens in their mobile web browser. Web users stay in their current browser with a new tab or window.
</Note>

### SMS attachment behavior

For SMS messages, attachments convert to text links:

- Short, trackable URLs
- Clear labeling (e.g., "Waiver Form: [link]")
- Character count considerations apply
- Multiple attachments listed sequentially

## Attachment-specific features

### Forms attachments

When you attach a form:

- **Direct access**: Athletes click to open and complete immediately
- **No login friction**: Forms can be set to not require authentication
- **Response tracking**: Submissions appear in your Forms → Responses section
- **Common uses**: Waivers, emergency contacts, feedback surveys, registration

<Tip>
  Attach your waiver form to welcome messages using automation - ensure every new athlete completes it immediately.
</Tip>

### Product attachments

Product links in messages:

- **Show key details**: May display price and description based on viewing context
- **Direct purchase path**: One click to product page
- **Payment ready**: Athletes can purchase immediately if payment info is on file
- **Perfect for**: Limited offers, new program launches, membership renewals

### Session/Scheduler attachments

Scheduler links provide:

- **Full scheduler view**: Athletes see your availability calendar
- **Real-time availability**: Always shows current open slots
- **Credit display**: Shows if sessions require credits
- **Immediate booking**: Athletes can book without leaving the flow

<Warning>
  Always ensure your scheduler has available times before sending. Athletes clicking on an empty scheduler creates frustration.
</Warning>

### Media attachments

Media from your Media Hub:

- **All file types**: Videos, images, PDFs, documents
- **No size limits**: Attach large training videos without worry
- **Multiple files**: Attach several items in one message
- **Organized delivery**: Files appear in order selected

## Best practices for attachments

### Strategic attachment use

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Announcements">
    **Perfect for**: New program launches, schedule updates, required forms

    **Example message**: New Season Registration Open! Complete these 2 quick steps: Fill out the attached waiver Book your assessment session Questions? Reply to this message![Waiver Form] [Spring Schedule]
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Direct Messages">
    **Perfect for**: Personalized program delivery, payment reminders

    **Example message**: Hey Sarah! Your custom training program is ready! I've attached the program and this week's schedule. Let me know if you have questions! [Sarah's Program] [Week 1 Schedule]
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SMS Messages">
    **Perfect for**: Urgent forms, payment links

    **Example message**: Tournament waiver due today! Complete now: [Waiver Link]

    Keep it under 160 characters with link.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multiple attachments strategy

When attaching multiple items:

1. **Order matters**: Place most important attachment first
2. **Group logically**: Keep related items together
3. **Explain each**: Brief description of what each link contains
4. **Don't overwhelm**: Maximum 3-4 attachments per message

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes attach files in their replies?">
    Athletes can attach photos and videos when sending direct messages to you, but cannot attach documents or other file types. They access this through the media button in their message composer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete an attached form/product/session?">
    The link in sent messages will no longer work. Always keep active any items you've attached to messages, or send a follow-up if you need to remove something.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do attachments work in archived conversations?">
    Yes, attachment links remain functional in archived conversations. The links point to live content, so they'll always show current information (like updated scheduler availability).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I see who clicked on attachments?">
    For forms, you can see who submitted. For products, track through transactions. Session bookings appear in your calendar. General link clicks aren't tracked individually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to Media Hub file sizes?">
    No, there's no size limit for files in your Media Hub. However, consider athlete bandwidth - very large video files may be slow to load on mobile connections.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Attachment templates**: Create message templates with common attachment combinations. For example, a "New Client Welcome" template with waiver form + first session scheduler + program overview video.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Batch sending**: When sending the same attachments to multiple people, use tags to select all recipients at once. Each person still receives their individual message thread.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Follow-up strategy**: After attaching a form or scheduler, set a reminder to follow up with anyone who hasn't completed the action within 48 hours.
</Tip>
