## What is the Inbox?

Your Inbox is the central communication hub where you manage all messages with athletes and parents. Think of it as your coaching command center - every conversation, announcement, and text message flows through here.

## Quick decision guide

<Accordion title="Which message type should I use?">
  **Use In-App Messages when:**

  - Communicating with athletes who regularly use the app
  - Sending detailed instructions or feedback
  - Cost is a concern (free messaging)
  - You need back-and-forth conversation

  **Use SMS when:**

  - You need immediate attention
  - Reaching parents who don't use the app
  - Sending last-minute schedule changes
  - Athletes might not check the app regularly

  **Use Announcements when:**

  - Broadcasting to the entire team
  - Sending weekly schedules or updates
  - Making general announcements
  - You don't need replies in CoachIQ
</Accordion>

## Important limitations to know

</Warning>

<Note>
  **SMS costs apply**: Each SMS message (sent or received) costs $0.0079. Mass texts to 100 athletes = $0.79.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Announcement limit**: Maximum 400 recipients per announcement by default. Contact support to increase this limit.
