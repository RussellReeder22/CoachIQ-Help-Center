## What are tags?

Tags are labels you create to organize athletes into groups. Instead of selecting 20 individual athletes every time you message the varsity team, tag them once as "Varsity" and message the entire group with one click.

Think of tags as your custom mailing lists that work across all message types.

## Setting up your tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to People">
    Go to **People** in your main navigation to access your athlete database.

    <Frame>
      ![Clients Page Pn](/images/clients-page.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new tags">
    Look for the tags section in your People area. Create tags that match your communication needs.

    Examples to create:

    - "Spring 2024 Team"
    - "Competition Squad"
    - "Monday/Wednesday Group"
    - "Needs Medical Form"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply tags to athletes">
    Select one or more athletes and apply relevant tags:

    1. Check the boxes next to athlete names
    2. Choose "Add Tags" from the bulk actions
    3. Select which tags to apply
    4. Save changes

    <Tip>
      **Bulk tagging**: Select all athletes who train on Tuesdays, then apply a "Tuesday Training" tag to message them about schedule changes.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify tag assignments">
    Filter by each tag to confirm the right athletes are included. This prevents messaging mistakes.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compose and send">
    Write your message and send to the entire group at once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Combining multiple tags

You can message athletes who have ANY of several tags:

- Select "Elite Program" tag
- Also select "Advanced Training" tag
- Message goes to anyone in EITHER group

<Note>
  **Overlap handling**: If an athlete has both tags, they still only receive one message.
</Note>

## Strategic tagging for different message types

### For In-App messages

Best tags for In-App group messages:

- Program enrollment ("Fall Basketball", "Speed Training")
- Feedback groups ("Needs Form Review", "Technique Focus")
- Progress tracking ("Ready for Advanced", "Competition Eligible")

### For SMS messages

Cost-conscious tags for urgent SMS:

- "Primary Contacts" (parents who need immediate updates)
- "No App Access" (those who only receive SMS)
- "Emergency Contacts" (for weather/safety issues)

### For announcements

Broad tags for announcements:

- "All Athletes 2024"
- "Parents"
- "Summer Camp Registered"

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can an athlete have multiple tags?">
    Yes! Athletes can have unlimited tags. Use multiple tags to create detailed segments (e.g., "Varsity" + "Needs Payment" + "Tuesday Group").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do removed athletes keep their tags?">
    If you remove someone from your People list, they lose all tags. If they're re-added later, you'll need to retag them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes see their tags?">
    No, tags are internal organization tools only visible to coaches and admins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a tag?">
    The tag is removed from all athletes, but it doesn't delete the athletes themselves. Past messages sent using that tag remain unchanged.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I message athletes who DON'T have a tag?">
    Not directly, but you can filter for athletes without specific tags in the People section, then select them manually for messaging.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

<Tip>
  **Naming convention**: Use clear, consistent naming:

  - ❌ "Tues" → ✅ "Tuesday Training"
  - ❌ "Good kids" → ✅ "Advanced Level"
  - ❌ "\$\$" → ✅ "Payment Outstanding"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Color coding**: While CoachIQ doesn't have colored tags, use prefixes:

  - "TEAM: Varsity"
  - "STATUS: Active"
  - "URGENT: Needs Form"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test before sending**: Always filter by a tag in People first to verify you're messaging the right group, especially for SMS (which has costs).
</Tip>
