## Why SMS messaging matters

SMS gives you a direct line to athletes and parents through text messaging - the communication channel with a 98% open rate. Unlike app-based messages, SMS reaches everyone with a phone, making it perfect for urgent updates and reaching parents who don't use the CoachIQ app.

## Your business phone number

CoachIQ provides you with a dedicated business phone number for professional text communication. This keeps your personal number private while maintaining professional boundaries.

### How it works
- You get a unique phone number exclusively for your coaching business
- Send and receive texts through CoachIQ (desktop or mobile app)
- Parents can call this number (with call forwarding to your phone)
- All messages stay organized in your Inbox
- Full conversation history maintained

<Note>
**Behind the scenes**: CoachIQ uses enterprise-grade SMS infrastructure to ensure reliable message delivery and compliance with messaging regulations.

</Step>

<Step title="Complete 10DLC registration">
You'll see the 10DLC Compliance form. This is required by law for business texting.

Enter your preferred area codes (primary and backup).
</Step>

<Step title="Submit your application">
Click **Begin** to submit your application. The information goes through verification to ensure compliance with business messaging regulations.

<Warning>
**Processing time**: Approval typically takes **one week**. This is standard for business number verification and ensures your messages won't be blocked as spam.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure call forwarding (optional)">
Once approved, set up call forwarding in your settings:
- Parents can call your business number

**Save templates**: Keep common messages saved in your notes:
"Practice moved to [TIME] due to [REASON]. Location: [PLACE]. Reply to confirm."
