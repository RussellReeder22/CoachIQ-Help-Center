## What are In-App messages?

In-App messages are your direct line to athletes through the CoachIQ platform. These messages appear in the athlete's app and portal, creating a private conversation thread between you and your athletes - similar to texting but without the phone charges.

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Quick feedback loop**: After each training session, send personalized In-App messages to 2-3 athletes with specific feedback. This builds strong coach-athlete relationships.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Attachment combo**: Pair a form with a session scheduler - "Please fill out this injury prevention form, then book your recovery session."
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Template messages**: Keep common messages in a notes app to copy/paste, like session reminders or homework assignments.
</Tip>

## Limitations to remember

- Athletes must have app or portal access
- Messages cannot be deleted once sent
- No read receipts (you can't see if the message was read)
