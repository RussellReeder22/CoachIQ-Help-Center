Every CoachIQ account includes free access to GoHighLevel (GHL)—a powerful CRM with built-in email marketing. This means you can replace tools like MailChimp, ConvertKit, or Constant Contact and manage everything from one platform.

## Why use GHL for email marketing

Your email list is the only audience you truly own. Social platforms change algorithms—but your contacts stay with you in your CRM. Every campaign you send trains your list to open, click, and engage with your offers.

With GHL included in your CoachIQ subscription, you get:
- Professional email campaigns (no extra software)
- Pre-built templates by industry
- Drag-and-drop design editor
- Scheduling and automation
- Analytics on opens and clicks

## Campaigns vs Templates

| Type | Purpose | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Campaigns** | One-off emails for specific purposes | Product launches, announcements, seasonal promos |
| **Templates** | Reusable designs you save and pull up anytime | Weekly newsletters, recurring promotions |

Build templates once for consistent branding, then create campaigns when you have something to send.

## Create your first campaign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Email Marketing">
    From your GHL dashboard, click **Marketing** in the left sidebar, then select **Emails**.

    You'll see three tabs: **Statistics**, **Campaigns**, and **Templates**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a new campaign">
    Click **Campaigns**, then **New** in the top right.

    You can also create folders (Promotions, Newsletters, Launches) to stay organized as your campaign library grows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a starting point">
    Select from:
    - **Blank** — Start from scratch
    - **Email Marketing Templates** — GHL's pre-built designs by industry (coaching, fitness, business, etc.)
    - **Your Templates** — Designs you've saved

    <Tip>
    GHL templates are great for beginners—just swap in your own text and images.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your editor type">
    If starting blank, choose your editor:

    | Editor | Best For |
    |--------|----------|
    | **Plain Text** | Personal messages, reminders, direct communication |
    | **Design Editor** | Promotional emails, launches, visually branded content |
    | **Code Editor** | HTML developers with custom needs |

    Plain text emails often feel more personal and can outperform designed emails because they cut through promotional noise.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your campaign">
    Enter a descriptive name at the top (e.g., "Spring Training Launch" or "Weekly Newsletter - Jan 15"). This keeps your campaign list organized.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the Design Editor

The Design Editor is a drag-and-drop builder for visual emails.

### Adding elements

Drag elements from the left panel into your email:
- **Text** — Headlines, body copy
- **Images** — Photos, graphics
- **Button** — Call-to-action buttons
- **Logo** — Your brand mark
- **Dividers** — Visual separators
- **Social** — Social media links
- **Video** — Embedded video thumbnails

### Keep it simple

A clean email with one clear action outperforms cluttered emails with multiple links. Every extra element is a potential distraction.

**Recommended structure:**
1. Logo
2. Headline
3. Short copy (2-3 sentences)
4. One button (your CTA)
5. Footer

### Preview on all devices

Click the preview icons to see how your email looks on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Most people read email on their phones—make sure it looks good there.

## Writing effective subject lines

Your subject line determines whether people open or ignore your email. Access it by clicking **Send or Schedule**.

**Tips:**
- Keep it short and curiosity-driven
- Avoid sounding like an advertisement
- Write like you're texting a friend, not a corporation

## Scheduling and sending

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Send Now** | Delivers immediately |
| **Schedule** | Pick a specific date and time |
| **Batch** | Send to segments in smaller groups (useful for large lists) |
| **RSS** | Auto-send when new content is published (for newsletters) |

<Warning>
Always schedule ahead when possible. Nothing feels worse than spotting a typo after hitting Send Now.
</Warning>

## Save time with templates

If you send similar emails regularly (newsletters, monthly promos), save them as templates:

1. Build your design once
2. Click **Save as Template**
3. Reuse it for future campaigns—just update the content

Templates protect your branding consistency, especially if multiple team members send emails.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should I use plain text or designed emails?">
    Use **plain text** for personal communication, reminders, and messages that should feel like they're coming directly from you.

    Use **designed emails** for launches, promotions, and branded announcements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I avoid the spam folder?">
    - Don't use ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation marks
    - Avoid spam trigger words ("FREE!!!", "Act Now")
    - Send from a verified domain
    - Include an unsubscribe link
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the best time to send?">
    Test with your audience. Generally, Tuesday-Thursday mornings perform well, but your athletes may have different patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from Announcements?">
    **Announcements** (in CoachIQ) are quick broadcasts to your athletes via email + push + Channels.

    **Email Marketing** (in GHL) gives you full campaign tools: design editor, templates, scheduling, segmentation, and detailed analytics. Use it for newsletters, promotions, and lead nurturing.
