## What are announcements?

Announcements are your broadcast system for team-wide communication. Think of them as your digital bulletin board - one message that reaches everyone through multiple channels simultaneously.

### How athletes receive announcements

## Why use announcements?

Perfect for information that:

- Affects the entire team or large groups
- Doesn't require individual responses
- Should be documented and easily referenced
- Needs professional email formatting

Common uses:

- Weekly training schedules
- Tournament information
- Registration deadlines
- Team achievements
- Policy updates
- Seasonal information
- Quick last minute updates

## Creating an announcement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open announcement composer">
    Navigate to **Inbox** → **Create New** → Select **Announcement**

    <Frame>
      
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your recipients">
    In the "Send to" field, you can:

    - Type "Everyone" to broadcast to all athletes
    - Use tags to target specific groups (e.g., "Varsity Team", "New Athletes")
    - Select specific individuals if needed

    <Note>
      **Recipient limit**: 400 contacts per announcement by default. Contact support if you need to increase this limit.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add announcement heading">
    Enter a clear, descriptive heading. This becomes:

    - The email subject line
    - The push notification title
    - The announcement title in the app

    Good examples:

    - "Week of March 15 - Training Schedule"
    - "Spring Tournament Registration Now Open"
    - "Important: Facility Closure March 20"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compose your message">
    Write your announcement content. This appears as the email body and full announcement text.

    Format tips:

    - Use line breaks for readability
    - Include all essential information
    - Add dates, times, and locations clearly
    - Keep paragraphs short for mobile reading

    Example:\
    Team,\
    This week's schedule has been updated to accommodate the tournament prep:\
    Monday & Wednesday: Regular practice 4-6pm\
    Tuesday: Film review 5-6pm (classroom)\
    Thursday: Extended practice 4-7pm\

## Pro tips

<Tip>
  **Weekly rhythm**: Send a consistent weekly announcement every Sunday night with the upcoming week's schedule. Athletes and parents will learn to expect and check for it.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Template strategy**: Create announcement templates for recurring communications like weekly schedules, tournament info, and weather cancellations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Attachment combo**: Pair announcements with forms - "Spring season starts March 1. Complete the attached medical form by February 20."
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Emergency protocol**: For urgent cancellations, send an announcement first (for documentation), then follow with SMS to ensure immediate awareness.
