## What are announcements?

Announcements are your broadcast system for team-wide communication. Think of them as your digital bulletin board - one message that reaches everyone through multiple channels simultaneously.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your recipients">
    In the "Send to" field, you can:

    - Type "Everyone" to broadcast to all athletes
    - Use tags to target specific groups (e.g., "Varsity Team", "New Athletes")
    - Select specific individuals if needed

    <Note>
      **Recipient limit**: 400 contacts per announcement by default. Contact support if you need to increase this limit.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add announcement heading">
    Enter a clear, descriptive heading. This becomes:

    - The email subject line

    - Use line breaks for readability
    - Include all essential information

</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Template strategy**: Create announcement templates for recurring communications like weekly schedules, tournament info, and weather cancellations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Attachment combo**: Pair announcements with forms - "Spring season starts March 1. Complete the attached medical form by February 20."
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Emergency protocol**: For urgent cancellations, send an announcement first (for documentation), then follow with SMS to ensure immediate awareness.
