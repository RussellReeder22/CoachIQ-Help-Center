## Your website is the starting point

Direct all athletes and parents to your website. It's their homepage for everything:

- Finding your programs and pricing
- Purchasing memberships or packages
- Accessing the member login (Athlete Portal)
- Signing up for camps, clinics, or new offerings

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Tip>
**Train your athletes**: When anyone asks "how do I sign up?" or "where do I book?" - the answer is always your website. Make it the single source of truth.
</Tip>

---

## Step 1: Athlete selects a product

Athletes visit your website and navigate to your pricing or products page. They choose the plan that fits their needs:

- Monthly membership (1x, 2x, or 3x per week)
- Session package (10-pack, etc.)
- Camp or clinic registration
- Trial session

## Step 2: Athlete completes purchase

When they click to purchase, the checkout process handles everything:

- **Payment collected** via Stripe
- **Account created** automatically (email + password)
- **Waiver and terms signed** (if you've configured this on the product)
- **Credits granted** (if it's a package or membership)

<Note>
**Waiver collection**: You can require athletes to sign a waiver during checkout. This is configured in your product settings.
</Note>

## Step 3: Athlete lands in the portal

After purchase, the athlete is automatically logged into the **Athlete Portal** - their member hub.

From here they can:

- **Book sessions** using their credits or membership
- **View their membership** and billing
- **Message you** through the inbox
- **Access programs** (if you offer them)
- **See upcoming sessions** on their schedule

## Step 4: Athlete downloads the app (optional)

For the best experience, athletes can download the CoachIQ app:

- **iOS**: Available on the App Store
- **Android**: Available on Google Play

The app syncs with the web portal - same account, same data, accessible anywhere.

<Tip>
**Encourage app downloads**: Athletes who use the app book more consistently and are easier to communicate with via push notifications.
</Tip>

## What athletes see after joining

Once an athlete purchases and enters the portal, they have access to:

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Schedule** | Book sessions using credits or membership |
| **Products** | Purchase additional packages or upgrades |
| **Inbox** | Message their coach directly |
| **Billing** | View membership, update payment method |
| **Profile** | Update personal information |

---

## Customize the welcome experience

When new athletes join, you can automatically:

- Send a **welcome message** via email or SMS
- Deliver **onboarding instructions**
- Share **what to expect** for their first session

<Frame>

This is configured through automations.

  <Step title="Parent browses pricing">
    They see your options: 1x/week ($149/mo), 2x/week ($249/mo), 3x/week ($349/mo).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parent selects 2x/week plan">
    They click "Sign Up" and enter payment info.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Account is created">
    Email, password, and waiver are handled during checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parent lands in portal">
    They see the welcome message and can immediately book their first sessions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parent books sessions">
    Using their membership, they book Tuesday and Thursday at 5pm.
