## Phase 1: Foundation

Complete these steps first. We can't build your website until we have this info.

### Step 1: Complete your onboarding form

You received a personalized onboarding form link in your welcome email. This tells us everything we need to build your website:

- Business name and sport
- Your bio and coaching background
- Services you offer
- Pricing structure
- Social media handles

<Warning>
**Start here.** Nothing else can begin until this form is complete.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Upload your photos

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Content → Media Hub
</Info>

Upload the images we'll use on your website:

- **Logo** (required)
- **Headshot** (required)
- Action shots of you coaching
- Facility photos
- Any other images you want on your site

<Tip>
Upload more than you think you need. We'll select the best ones for your site.

### Step 3: Connect Stripe

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Payments → Products → Connect Stripe (or Settings → Stripe Portal)
</Info>

Stripe handles all your payments—credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. Deposits go directly to your bank.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or sign in to Stripe">
    **New to Stripe?** Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create a free account first.

    **Already have Stripe?** You're ready to connect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to CoachIQ">
    Click **Connect Stripe** and authorize the connection. Takes about 2 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    You'll see a green "Connected" status when complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Create your products

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Payments → Products → Create
</Info>

Products are anything athletes can buy from you. Create these now so we can add them to your website.

**Common products to start with:**

| Product Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Private lesson | 60-min session, $75 |
| Group session | Small group training, $35 |
| Session package | 10-pack of lessons, $650 |
| Monthly membership | Unlimited access, $199/month |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create">
    From Payments → Products, click **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the basics">
    - Product name (what athletes see)
    - Description
    - Price
    - Payment type (one-time, subscription, or package)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and repeat">
    Create 2-3 products to start. You can add more anytime.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with your most popular offering. You can always add more products later.

## Phase 2: Launch

Once Phase 1 is complete, we'll start building your website. While that's happening, set up your scheduling and Athlete Portal.

### Step 5: Set up your scheduling

Scheduling has two parts: **Availability** (when you're free) and **Schedulers** (what athletes book).

#### Create your availability first

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Schedule → Availability → Add Availability
</Info>

Availability defines when you're open for bookings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an availability block">
    Click **Add Availability** and name it clearly (e.g., "Private Lesson Hours").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your hours">
    Choose which days and times you're available for this type of session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    You'll pull this availability into your scheduler next.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="Availability guide" icon="clock" href="/scheduling/create-your-availability">

</Card>

#### Then create your scheduler

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Schedule → Schedulers → Create
</Info>

Schedulers are what athletes actually book. Each scheduler uses your availability plus booking rules.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new scheduler">
    Click **Create** and give it a name athletes will understand (e.g., "Book a Private Lesson").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    - **Duration**: How long is each session?
    - **Capacity**: How many athletes per slot? (1 for private, more for groups)
    - **Availability**: Select the availability you created above
    - **Payment**: Require payment or credits to book
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    Book a test session yourself to make sure it works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Using session packages?** Most coaches (85%+) use credits. When athletes buy a package, they get credits to book sessions. This is configured in your scheduler settings.
</Note>

### Step 6: Set up your Athlete Portal

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Athlete Portal → Edit
</Info>

The Athlete Portal is your athletes' home base—where they book sessions, view schedules, and access everything you offer.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your branding">
    Go to **Settings → Design** and set your brand colors and theme (light/dark mode).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Schedule page">
    Add your schedulers so athletes can book sessions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Products page">
    Add your products so athletes can purchase packages and memberships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the experience">
    Click **View** to see exactly what your athletes will see.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 7: Review and launch

Once your website is ready, we'll send it to you for review.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your website">
    We'll email you a preview link. Check that everything looks right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request changes">
    Let us know if anything needs adjusting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Align on launch date">
    Pick a date to go live. We'll coordinate with you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Share your new website and booking links with athletes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**First things to share after launch:**
- Add your website to your Instagram/social media bio
- Email your current athletes with your new booking link
- Update your email signature
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need Stripe if I use Venmo or Cash App?">
    Yes. All CoachIQ payments go through Stripe. You can still accept cash or Venmo separately, but online bookings and purchases require Stripe.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can you migrate my existing clients?">
    Yes! Send us your contact list and we'll import them. If you have bookings in Acuity, Upperhand, or another platform, share access and we can migrate those too.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I make a mistake during setup?">
    Everything is editable. You can change prices, update schedulers, and reconfigure your portal anytime. If you get stuck, jump on Office Hours and we'll fix it together.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to finish everything before taking clients?">
    No. Once you have Stripe connected, products created, and a scheduler live, you can start accepting bookings. The rest improves the experience but isn't required to get started.
