## Step 1: Connect your Stripe account

**Why this matters**: Without payment processing connected, you can't accept bookings or charge for services. This is your foundation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to payment settings">
    From your dashboard, click on **Settings** in the left sidebar, then select **Stripe Portal**.

    <Frame>
      ![Stripe Settings Location](/images/stripe-settings-location.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Stripe">
    Click the **Connect Stripe** button. You'll be redirected to Stripe's secure connection page.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="New to Stripe">
        1. Click **Create a Stripe account**
        2. Enter your business information
        3. Provide bank account details for payouts
        4. Complete identity verification

        <Note>
          **Processing time**: Stripe verification typically takes 1-2 business days. You can continue setup while waiting.
        </Note>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Existing Stripe User">
        1. Click **Sign in to Stripe**
        2. Log in with your Stripe credentials
        3. Authorize CoachIQ to connect
        4. Confirm your connection

        <Tip>
          **Already have a Stripe account?** Perfect! Connection takes less than 2 minutes.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    After connecting, you'll be redirected back to CoachIQ. You should see a green checkmark and "Connected" status.

    <Check>
      **Success!** Your payment processing is now active. You can accept credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Don't skip this step! Many features in CoachIQ require payment processing to be connected, including paid sessions, program sales, and automated billing.
</Warning>

**What's next**: Now that payments are ready, let's create your service offerings.

---

## Step 2: Add your products and services

**Why this matters**: Products define what you offer and how much you charge. These become the building blocks for everything else in CoachIQ.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Products">
    From your dashboard, navigate to **Products** in the left sidebar, then click **\+ Create**.

    <Frame>
      ![Products Page](/images/Products-page.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first product">
    Fill in the essential details:

    - **Product name**: What you call this service (e.g., "60-Minute Personal Training Session")
    - **Description**: Brief explanation for clients
    - **Price**: Your standard rate
    - **Duration**: How long this service takes (if applicable)

    <Tip>
      **Start with your core offerings**: Begin with your 2-3 most popular services. You can add more products anytime as your business grows.
    </Tip>
    <Frame>
      ![Product Builder](/images/product-builder.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure payment options">
    Choose how clients will pay:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="One-Time Payment">
        Best for: Single sessions, drop-ins, consultations

        - Client pays once at booking
        - No recurring billing
        - Immediate access after payment
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Package/Bundle">
        Best for: Session packages (e.g., 10-pack)

        - Client pays upfront for multiple sessions
        - Better value per session
        - Builds commitment
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Subscription">
        Best for: Monthly training, ongoing programs

        - Recurring monthly billing
        - Predictable revenue for you
        - Continuous client engagement
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add more products">
    Repeat the process to add your other key services. Common products coaches create:

    - Individual training sessions (30/60/90 minutes)
    - Small group training
    - Program access (monthly/quarterly)
    - Assessment or consultation sessions
    - Video analysis packages

    <Check>
      **Nice work!** You've defined your service catalog. Clients can now see exactly what you offer and at what price.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many products should I create?">
    Start with 2-5 core offerings. You can always add more later. Most successful coaches begin with:

    - One individual session option
    - One package/bundle option
    - One group or specialty offering

    Avoid overwhelming clients with too many choices initially.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change prices later?">
    Yes! You can update product prices anytime from the Products page. Changes apply to new bookings only—existing client agreements remain unchanged unless you manually update them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I offer free consultations?">
    Create a product with a price of \$0. This still allows clients to book through your scheduler while keeping everything organized in your system.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**What's next**: With products defined, let's set up when you're available for bookings.

---

## Step 3: Set up your availability and schedulers

**Why this matters**: Schedulers allow clients to book sessions automatically based on your availability. This eliminates back-and-forth scheduling and lets you control your calendar.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Schedulers">
    From your dashboard, click **Schedule** in the left sidebar, then select **Schedulers**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define your general availability">
    Before creating schedulers, set your overall availability:

    1. Click the **\+** button next to **Availability** in the Schedule section
    2. Select your typical working hours for each day for a particular session (ex: Private Sessions, High School Boys Group Sessions, etc.)
    4. Set your timezone

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Start conservative with your availability. It's easier to add more time slots later than to remove ones that don't work for you.
    </Tip>
    <Frame>
      ![Availability Ex](/images/availability-ex.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize specific availability (optional)">
    If this availability needs different hours than your general availability:

    1. Set specific days/times for this service
    3. Useful for blackout dates or additional training times

    <Note>
      **Example**: You might offer group training only on Tuesday/Thursday evenings but one evening may fall on a holiday that you won't be operating.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first scheduler">
    Click **\+ New Scheduler** and configure:

    <Frame>
      ![Create New Scheduler](/images/create-new-scheduler.png)
    </Frame>
    **Basic Information**:

    - **Scheduler name**: (e.g., "1-on-1 Training Bookings")
    - **Description**: What clients see when booking

    **Booking Rules**:

    - **Session duration**: Auto-filled from product (can override)
    - **Buffer time**: Gap before/after sessions (recommend 15-30 min)
    - **Advance notice**: Minimum booking notice (e.g., 24 hours)
    - **Booking window**: How far in advance clients can book (e.g., 30 days)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create additional schedulers">
    Repeat for different services or scenarios:

    - Separate scheduler for group sessions
    - Different scheduler for assessment/consultation
    - Special scheduler for VIP clients with different terms

    <Tip>
      **Quick setup**: Most coaches need 2-3 schedulers total—one for individual sessions, one for groups, and optionally one for consultations.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between availability and schedulers?">
    **Availability** = Your overall calendar constraints (when you're potentially available)

    **Schedulers** = Specific booking portals that use your availability plus additional rules for different services

    Think of availability as your hours availabile and schedulers as filtered views of that schedule for different purposes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I block out vacation time?">
    Go to **Schedule → Availiabilty → Specific Dates** to create a new unavailabilty.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**What's next**: Now let's create training programs to deliver to your clients.

---

## Step 4: Set up your training programs (Optional but recommended)

**Why this matters**: Programs let you deliver structured training plans, workout routines, nutrition guidance, and educational content. They differentiate you from coaches who only offer "show up and workout" sessions.

<Info>
  **Time to complete**: 30-60 minutes depending on complexity. This step is optional but highly recommended—even a simple program dramatically increases perceived value.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Programs">
    From your dashboard, click **Programs** in the left sidebar, then click **\+ Create Program**.

    <Frame>
      ![Programs Main Page](/images/programs-main-page.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Program">
    Create a new program:

    1. Click **New **then **Select**
    2. Name your program (e.g., "8-Week Strength Foundation")
    3. Select your Series (Immediate Access, Complete and Progress, Drip)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Structure your program">
    Organize your program into phases or weeks:

    1. Click and drag either **Media **or **Lesson** into the builder
    2. Select the media/lesson you wish to add to your program
    3. You can customize the thumbnail for each node (optional)

    <Tip>
      **Start simple**: Your first program doesn't need to be perfect. A 4-week basic program with 3 workouts per week is better than no program at all. You can always create more sophisticated programs later.
    </Tip>
    <Frame>
      ![Programs Center Ui](/images/programs-center-ui.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure program settings">
    Set up how clients access and experience the program:

    - **Access type**: One-time purchase, subscription, or complementary to sessions
    - **Start date**: When client begins (immediately, specific date, or you trigger)
    - **Progression**: Linear, user-paced, or coach-released
    - **Notifications**: Remind clients about workouts and content

    <Check>
      **Fantastic!** You've created a professional training program. This positions you as a comprehensive coach, not just a session provider.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose how you want your athletes to access your program">
    Click the **Change **button in the top right bar to view the program's share settings.

    You can set your program to **Free, Paywalled, or Private:**

    1. **Free: **Anyone can access the program
    2. **Paywalled: **Lock your program behind your products. Only customers who purchase the corresponding selected products can view the program.
    3. **Private: **Directly assign your program to your athlete

    <Note>
      Note: You can only paywall or privately assign programs. Enabling both will cause issues with your athletes being able to view your programs.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need programs if I only do in-person training?">
    Not required, but highly recommended! Even for in-person-only coaches, programs provide:

    - Homework between sessions
    - Reference for clients to review technique
    - Perceived value (you're providing more than just the hour together)
    - Ability to serve clients while traveling

    Many coaches start with just documenting their in-person sessions as program workouts—this alone adds value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How detailed should my first program be?">
    **Example viable program**:

    - 4 weeks of workouts
    - 3 workout days per week
    - Basic exercise list with sets/reps
    - One rest day note per week

    This takes 30-45 minutes to create and is infinitely better than no program. Add detail over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can clients access programs on mobile?">
    Yes! The CoachIQ mobile app provides full access to programs, with video demonstrations, progress tracking, and workout logging. This is a huge differentiator for your clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**What's next**: Let's customize your athlete portal where clients access everything.

---

## Step 5: Customize your athlete portal

**Why this matters**: The athlete portal is your clients' home base—where they view workouts, book sessions, message you, and track progress. A well-configured portal creates a premium, professional experience.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Portal Settings">
    From your dashboard, go to **Edit **under **Athlete Portal**.

    <Frame>
      ![Athlete Portal Dashboard Ex](/images/athlete-portal-dashboard-ex.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your branding">
    Make the portal feel like YOUR brand:

    1. Visit the **Design** tab under **Settings**
    1. **Theme: **Light or Dark Mode
    2. **Brand colors**: Set primary and accent colors for buttons and text

    <Frame>
      ![Design Settings Portal](/images/design-settings-portal.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure portal modules">
    Choose which features clients see in their portal:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Schedule">
        Keep these enabled:

        - ✅ **Schedule**: View and book sessions
        - ✅ **Programs**: Access training programs
        - ✅ **Products**: Message you directly
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Products">
        Enable based on your coaching style:

        - 📊 **Nutrition**: Meal plans and macro tracking
        - 📹 **Media**: Exercise library and tutorials
        - 📝 **Forms**: Assessments and questionnaires
        - 💰 **Payments**: View invoices and billing
        - 👥 **Community**: Client-to-client interaction (group coaching)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Products">
        
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your portal">
    View the athlete experience:

    1. Click **Preview Portal** at the top
    2. Navigate through as a client would
    3. Check mobile responsive view
    4. Test booking flow
    5. Verify branding looks correct

    <Check>
      **Perfect!** Your athlete portal is now branded and configured. Clients will experience a professional, cohesive platform that feels uniquely yours.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can clients customize their own portal experience?">
    Yes! Clients can adjust their notification preferences, set measurement tracking goals, and organize their workout history. However, the overall branding and available features are controlled by you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between the portal and the mobile app?">
    They're the same experience on different platforms:

    - **Web portal**: Accessed via browser, great for desktop use
    - **Mobile app**: Native iOS/Android apps, optimized for on-the-go access

    All data syncs in real-time across platforms. Your branding applies to both automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do clients get portal access?">
    When you add a client to CoachIQ, they automatically receive an email invitation to create their portal account. You can also generate custom invite links from the Clients section.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**What's next**: Finally, let's review and launch your professional website.

## Common first-week questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm stuck on a step. Should I wait to continue?">
    No! Most steps are independent. If you're waiting on Stripe verification, for example, continue with programs, portal, and website setup. You can come back to payments when verification completes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if I'm doing this right?">
    If you can successfully:

    1. View your published website
    2. Click through to booking
    3. See your services and availability
    4. Complete a test booking

    Then you're doing it right! Everything else is optimization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="This seems overwhelming. What's the absolute minimum?">
    **Bare minimum to accept your first client**:

    1. Connect Stripe (20 min)
    2. Create one product (10 min)
    3. Create one scheduler (15 min)
    4. Publish website as-is (5 min)

    **Total: 50 minutes**

    You can add programs, customize portal, and refine website later. Get the booking engine running first.

  <Accordion title="What if I make a mistake during setup?">
    Everything is editable! There are no permanent mistakes. You can:

    - Update prices anytime
    - Modify schedulers
    - Rebuild programs
    - Redesign your website
    - Change portal settings

    Start with your best guess and refine based on real client feedback.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to complete everything before taking clients?">
    No! Many coaches successfully onboard clients with just steps 1-3 complete (payments, products, scheduling). The remaining steps enhance the experience but aren't blockers.

    That said, completing all six steps creates the best first impression and sets you up for long-term success.
