Clients open **your** app, see **your** brand—not a generic platform. With a Personalized App, your business gets its own presence in the Apple App Store, fully branded with your name, logo, and colors.

<Info>
**How it works**: CoachIQ builds and maintains the app. You provide your branding. The app is published under your Apple Developer account, so it's truly yours.
</Info>

## What is a Personalized App?

A Personalized App is a custom-branded version of CoachIQ published to the App Store under your business name. Your clients download **your** app—not CoachIQ—and experience your brand from the moment they open it.

**What's customized:**
- App name (your business name in the App Store)
- App icon (your logo)
- In-app colors and theming
- Splash screen
- App Store listing (description, screenshots—we design these with you)

**What stays the same:**
- All CoachIQ features (scheduling, payments, programs, messaging, etc.)
- Automatic updates as CoachIQ releases new functionality
- Ongoing maintenance and support

<Note>
**Currently available for iOS only.** Android personalized apps are not yet available.

## Key Benefits

Your own App Store presence creates instant credibility—parents and athletes trust businesses with dedicated apps. Your icon lives on their home screen, keeping your brand visible every day. Push notifications reach them directly, and everything they need is one tap away.

For you, it means higher engagement, better retention, and a professional edge over competitors still using generic platforms.

## How It Works

<Steps>

<Step title="Submit Your Request">
Let us know you're interested in a Personalized App. We'll schedule a consultation to discuss your brand, timeline, and any questions.

</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Your Apple Developer Account">
Your app is published under **your** Apple Developer account—meaning you own it. If you don't have one, we'll guide you through setup.

<Note>
Apple charges $99/year for a Developer account. This is paid directly to Apple.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Provide Your Brand Assets">
Send us the essentials:
- Your logo (high-resolution)
- Brand colors (hex codes if you have them)
- Business name as you want it to appear
- A brief description of your business

We'll handle the rest, including designing your App Store screenshots and listing.
</Step>

<Step title="We Build and Submit">
CoachIQ handles all technical development. Once your branding is finalized, we submit the app to Apple for review. Apple's approval process typically takes 1–2 weeks.
</Step>

<Step title="Launch Your App">
Your app goes live in the App Store. Share the download link with your athletes and parents, and start building your brand presence.
