Don't see what you're looking for? We're listening.

CoachIQ is built for coaches, and we know every training business is different. If you have an idea for a feature that would transform how you run your business—or need something custom that doesn't exist yet—let us know. We personally review every request and can build custom solutions tailored to your needs.

**How it works**: Submit your idea, we review it, and if it's a fit, we'll provide a custom quote and timeline.

## What You Can Request

This Power-Up is for coaches who want to:

- **Expedite a feature** — Have an idea that's on our roadmap? We can prioritize building it for you sooner.
- **Request something new** — Need functionality that doesn't exist yet? Tell us what you're envisioning.
- **Customize existing features** — Want a feature to work differently for your specific use case? We can adapt.
- **Integrate with other tools** — Need CoachIQ to connect with software you already use? Let's talk.

If you can describe it, we can explore building it.

## How It Works

<Steps>

<Step title="Submit Your Request">
Tell us what you need. Be as detailed as possible—describe the problem you're trying to solve, how you imagine the feature working, and why it matters to your business.
</Step>

<Step title="We Review">
Our team personally reviews every request. We'll assess feasibility, scope, and how it fits with the platform.
</Step>

<Step title="Custom Quote">
If we can build it, we'll provide a custom quote with pricing and estimated timeline. No obligation—just clarity on what's possible.
</Step>

<Step title="We Build It">
Once approved, we get to work. You'll have direct communication with our team throughout the process.
</Step>

</Steps>

## What Makes a Good Request

The more context you provide, the better we can help. Strong requests typically include:

- **The problem you're solving** — What's frustrating or missing today?
- **How you'd use it** — Walk us through the workflow you're imagining
- **Why it matters** — How would this impact your business or your athletes' experience?

You don't need to be technical—just describe what you need in your own words.
