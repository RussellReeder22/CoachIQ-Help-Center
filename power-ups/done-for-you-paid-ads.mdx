## Why CoachIQ for Paid Ads?

Most marketing agencies don't understand youth sports. We do.

We've run campaigns for **100+ facilities and sports coaches** across baseball, soccer, basketball, football, volleyball, softball, and more. Our team knows exactly how to target parents, craft messaging that resonates, and build funnels that convert inquiries into booked sessions.

**Why we outperform generalist agencies:**
- We specialize exclusively in sports training and coaching businesses
- Our targeting is built around parents searching for training for their kids
- Our funnels are proven—refined across hundreds of campaigns
- Leads flow directly into CoachIQ, so follow-up is seamless
