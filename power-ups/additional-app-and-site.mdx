<Accordion title="How much does an additional app or site cost?">
Pricing depends on your specific setup. Contact our team and we'll provide details based on your needs.

<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple locations from one account?">
Yes. You'll have oversight across all your apps and sites while keeping each one independently managed.

<Accordion title="Do I need a Personalized App for each location?">
Not necessarily. We'll help you determine the best setup based on your branding and operational needs. Some businesses use one app across locations; others prefer separate branded apps.

That's fine. This Power-Up also supports online coaching ventures, specialized programs, or any business expansion that needs its own app or website.
