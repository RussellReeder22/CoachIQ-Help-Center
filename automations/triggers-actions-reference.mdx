| `{{field.user.booking.days_since_last}}` | Days since user's last booking | 7 |
| `{{field.user.booking.upcoming}}` | Whether user has upcoming booking | true or false |

<Tip>
Use `{{field.booking.session.title}}` in booking confirmations to remind users which session they registered for.

```
Hi {{field.user.firstName}},

You have {{field.user.credits.count}} credits remaining. 
They expire in {{field.user.credits.expire_days}} days.

Book your next session soon!
```

**This would send:**

```
