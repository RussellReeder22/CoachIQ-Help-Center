**Where to find this**: Tools → Automations → + New Automation
</Info>

By the end of this guide, every new member will automatically receive a welcome email with instructions to book their first session. You'll also tag them as an "Active Member" so you can easily find them later.

No templates, no shortcuts—we're building from scratch so you understand how it works.

## What You're Building

| Trigger      | Condition         | Actions                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| New Purchase | Is a subscription | 1. Send welcome email with booking link |
|              |                   | 2. Add "Active Member" tag              |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Automation Builder">
    From your dashboard, navigate to **Automations** and click **Create Automation**.

    You'll see a blank canvas with a prompt to choose your trigger.

    <Frame>
      ![Create New Automation Pn](/images/create-new-automation.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Trigger">
    Click **Select Trigger** and choose **New Purchase**.

    This trigger fires whenever someone buys any product—memberships, credit packs, camps, or one-time sessions.

    <Frame>
      ![Trigger Options Pn](/images/trigger-options.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Condition">
    We only want this automation to run for new members, not every purchase. Let's add a filter.

    Click **Add Condition** and select **Is a subscription**.

    Now this automation will only fire when someone purchases a subscription product—not one-time buys like camps or drop-in sessions.

    <Tip>
      Conditions are optional, but they help you target the right people. You can add multiple conditions to get more specific.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Your First Action — Send Email">
    Click **Add Action** and select **Send an Email**.

    Fill in the fields:

    | Field              | What to Enter                                    |
    | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | **To**             | User from trigger (this is automatic)            |
    | **Subject**        | `Welcome to the team, {{field.user.firstName}}!` |
    | **Message**        | See template below                               |
    | **Attach Session** | Select your main training session                |

    Here's a welcome email you can copy and paste:

    ```
    Hey {{field.user.firstName}},
    
    You're officially part of the team! 🎉
    
    Here's how to get started: book your first session using the link below. 
    If you have any questions, just reply to this email—I'm here to help.
    
    See you soon,
    [Your Name]
    ```

    <Note>
      **Dynamic fields** like `@User.FirstName` automatically insert each member's actual name. Your email stays personal without extra work.
    </Note>
    <Frame>
      ![Configuring the send email action](/images/automation-actions.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Second Action — Add Tag">
    Let's also tag new members so you can target them with future automations.

    Click **Add Action** and select **Add a Tag to a User**.

    | Field    | What to Enter                                |
    | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | **User** | User from trigger                            |
    | **Tag**  | Select "Active Member" (or create a new tag) |

    Now every new subscriber automatically gets tagged, making it easy to send announcements or check engagement later.

    <Frame>
      ![Adding a tag to the user](/images/add-tag-action.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Activate">
    Give your automation a clear name like **New Member Welcome**.

    Click **Save** and toggle the automation **ON**.

    <Check>
      **That's it!** Your automation is now live. The next person who purchases a subscription will automatically receive your welcome email and get tagged as an Active Member.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify It's Working

A few ways to confirm your automation is running:

- **Check the automation log**: Most automations show a history of recent runs
- **Make a test purchase**: Use a test account to subscribe and see if the email arrives
- **Wait for your next signup**: You'll see it appear in the automation history

## What You Just Learned

You now understand the three building blocks of every automation:

- **Triggers** start automations when something happens (a purchase, booking, form submission)
- **Conditions** filter who it applies to (only subscriptions, only first-time buyers)
- **Actions** are what CoachIQ does automatically (send messages, add tags, manage credits)

Every automation in CoachIQ—no matter how complex—uses this same pattern.
