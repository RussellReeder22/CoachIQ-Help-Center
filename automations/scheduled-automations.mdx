Most automations react to something happening—a purchase, a booking, a form submission. Scheduled automations are different. They run on a schedule and **proactively find people** who match your criteria.

Think of it this way:

- **Event-based**: The doorbell rings, you answer it
- **Scheduled**: You check the mailbox every morning

This is how you build credit expiration reminders, inactive member outreach, weekly announcements, and milestone celebrations.

## When to Use Scheduled Automations

| Use Scheduled When...                              | Example                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| You need to check for a condition over time        | Credits expiring in 7 days |
| You want to catch people who _didn't_ do something | Haven't booked in 2 weeks  |
| You want recurring announcements                   | Weekly schedule release    |
| You need to celebrate milestones                   | 3-month member check-in    |

<Tip>
  **Rule of thumb**: If you're checking _status_ rather than reacting to an _event_, use a scheduled automation.
</Tip>

## Setting Your Schedule

You have three timing options:

| Schedule                             | Best For              | Example                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Every day at [time]**              | Time-sensitive checks | Credit expiration reminders, daily trial alerts  |
| **Once a week on [day] at [time]**   | Weekly operations     | Inactive member outreach, schedule announcements |
| **Once a month on [date] at [time]** | Monthly milestones    | Subscription anniversaries, monthly check-ins    |

<Note>
  Scheduled automations use your timezone from **Settings**. If you're in Eastern Time, "Monday at 9am" means 9am Eastern.
</Note>

## Conditions: Targeting the Right People

Scheduled automations require at least one condition. This prevents the automation from running for every single user in your system.

<Warning>
  **Required**: You must set at least one condition on scheduled automations. The builder won't let you activate without one.
</Warning>

### Available Conditions

| Condition                                | What It Checks                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Has a specific tag**                   | User has this tag                                           |
| **Doesn't have a specific tag**          | User doesn't have this tag                                  |
| **Has active subscription**              | User is currently subscribed                                |
| **Does not have an active subscription** | User has no active subscription                             |
| **Subscription active for X days**       | User has been subscribed for at least X days                |
| **Has available credits**                | User has at least 1 credit                                  |
| **Days since last booking is \> X**      | User hasn't booked in X+ days                               |
| **Days until credits expire \< X**       | User's credits expire within X days                         |
| **Credit count is X**                    | User's credits are less than / greater than / equal to X    |
| **Has upcoming booking**                 | User has a booking today / this week / no upcoming bookings |

### Combining Conditions

You can add multiple conditions to get more specific. All conditions must be true for a user to be included.

**Example**: Find members who are at risk of churning

- Has active subscription = Yes
- Days since last booking \> 14
- Doesn't have tag "On Vacation"

## How Scheduled Automations Run

Here's what happens when your scheduled automation fires:

1. **CoachIQ finds all users** matching your conditions (up to 1,000 per run)
2. **Executes your actions** once for each user found
3. **Logs the results** so you can see who was contacted

**Built-in spam prevention**: CoachIQ won't message the same person repeatedly. If someone matches your conditions two weeks in a row, they'll only get the message once—unless their status changes (like booking a session, then going inactive again).

<Info>
  **Example in action**: Every Monday at 9am, find everyone whose credits expire in less than 7 days → Send each of them a personalized reminder with their credit count and expiration date.
</Info>

## Dynamic Fields for Scheduled Automations

These personalization fields are **only available** in scheduled automations. They let you include real-time data about each user's credits, bookings, and activity.

### Credit Fields

| Field                        | What It Inserts                 |

| `@User.CreditsExpiring`      | Number of credits expiring soon |
| `@User.CreditExpirationDate` | Next expiration date            |
| `@User.DaysUntilExpiration`  | Days until credits expire       |

**Example message**:

```
You have @User.CreditsExpiring credits expiring in @User.DaysUntilExpiration days! 
Book now before you lose them.
```

### Booking Fields

| Field                         | What It Inserts               |

| `@User.BookingCountThisMonth` | Number of bookings this month |

**Example message**:

Come back this week?
```

<Note>
  Standard fields like `@User.FirstName`, `@User.LastName`, and `@User.Email` work in all automations, not just scheduled ones.

## Common Scheduled Automations

These are the most popular scheduled automations coaches use. Full setup instructions are in the [Automation Playbook](/automations/automation-playbook).

| Automation                                                                                       | Schedule             | What It Does                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Credit Expiration Reminder](/automations/automation-playbook#weekly-credit-expiration-reminder) | Weekly, Monday 9am   | Alerts members whose credits expire within 7 days      |
| [Inactive Member Check](/automations/automation-playbook#weekly-inactive-member-check)           | Weekly, Sunday 6pm   | Re-engages members who haven't booked in 14+ days      |
| [Weekly Schedule Release](/automations/automation-playbook#weekly-schedule-release)              | Weekly, Monday 8am   | Announces that the week's schedule is open for booking |
| [3-Month Milestone](/automations/automation-playbook#3-month-member-milestone)                   | Monthly, 1st at 10am | Celebrates members hitting their 3-month anniversary   |
| [Daily Trial Alert](/automations/automation-playbook#daily-trial-alert-for-coaches)              | Daily, 7am           | Notifies you about trial sessions happening today      |

## Tips for Scheduled Automations

<Tip>
  **Pick smart timing**. Send messages when people are likely to see them—not at 3am. Sunday evening works great for "plan your week" messages. Monday morning works for schedule announcements.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use tags to control frequency**. For milestone messages, add a tag like "3-Month Member" when someone hits that milestone, then remove it after the automation runs. This prevents repeat messages.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Start weekly, go daily only if needed**. Weekly checks work for most use cases. Daily checks are best for time-sensitive things like credit expirations or trial session alerts.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test with a tag filter first**. When setting up a new scheduled automation, add a condition like "Has tag = Test" and only tag yourself. Run it once to make sure it works before removing the filter.
</Tip>
