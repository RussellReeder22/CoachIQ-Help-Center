These are the automations CoachIQ coaches use most. Find your goal, copy the setup, customize the message—you'll be up and running in minutes.

<Note>
  Several of these use **Scheduled Automations**, which run on a schedule (daily, weekly, monthly) instead of reacting to an event. If you're new to those, check out [Scheduled Automations](/automations/scheduled-automations) for a deeper explanation.

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly Credit Expiration Reminder">
    **What it does**: Every week, find members whose credits expire in less than 7 days and remind them to book before they lose them.

    | Trigger                     | Condition                      | Action                 |

    ```

    <Note>
      **How milestone tags work**: You'll need a system to add the "3-Month Member" tag when someone hits that milestone. Some coaches do this manually, others create an automation based on subscription duration. The automation then removes the tag so they don't get the message twice.

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Daily Trial Alert for Coaches">
    **What it does**: Every morning, get a notification about any trial sessions happening today so you're prepared to convert.

    ```

    <Note>
      **This one's different**: Most automations message your members. This one messages YOU—it's a daily briefing so you never forget about a trial.
