You're busy coaching—not sitting at a computer sending emails. But the follow-ups pile up: welcome messages for new members, reminders about expiring credits, check-ins with people who haven't trained in a while. Things slip through the cracks.

Automations handle these tasks for you, automatically, in the background.

## How Automations Work

Every automation follows a simple formula:

<Card title="When THIS happens → Do THAT" icon="arrow-right">
  A member signs up, so CoachIQ sends them a welcome email. A booking gets cancelled, so CoachIQ follows up. You set it up once, and it runs forever.
</Card>

Each automation has three parts:

| Part | What It Does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Trigger** | The event that starts it | Someone purchases a membership |
| **Conditions** | Optional filters to target the right people | Only if it's their first purchase |
| **Actions** | What happens automatically | Send a welcome email + add a "New Member" tag |

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Here are automations CoachIQ coaches use every day:

| When this happens... | CoachIQ automatically... |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Someone buys a membership | Sends a welcome email with booking instructions |
| A member hasn't trained in 2 weeks | Sends a "we miss you" message |
| Credits are expiring in 7 days | Sends a reminder to book sessions |
| Someone submits a trial request form | Sends them a link to book their free session |
| A new member finishes their first session | Sends a follow-up asking how it went |

## What Can Start an Automation?

Automations can trigger when:

- Someone makes a purchase or starts a subscription
- Someone books or cancels a session
- A form gets submitted
- A session is completed (including no-shows)
- A subscription is cancelled
- On a schedule—daily, weekly, or monthly

## What Can Automations Do?

Once triggered, automations can:

- Send emails, SMS messages, in-app messages, or announcements
- Add or remove tags from members
- Add or redeem credits
- Grant or revoke program access
- Book or remove someone from a session
- Send data to external tools via webhooks

<Tip>
**Best uses for automations:**
- Messages you send over and over (welcome emails, booking confirmations)
- Follow-ups you forget to send (trial conversions, re-engaging inactive members)
- Time-sensitive alerts (credit expirations, camp prep reminders)
