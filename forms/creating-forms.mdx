This guide covers everything you need to build forms in CoachIQ — from quick template setups to fully custom builds.

<Info>
  **Where to find Forms**: Tools → Forms → **\+ Create Form**
</Info>

## Start with a template or blank form

When you create a new form, you choose your starting point:

<Frame>
  ![Form Templates](/images/form-templates.png)
</Frame>

| Option                     | Best for                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Website Form**           | Lead capture on your site — simple contact info + "how did you hear about us" |
| **Player Onboarding Form** | New athlete intake — contact info, goals, experience, parent details          |
| **Camp Form**              | Event registration — attendee info, emergency contacts, t-shirt sizes         |
| **Onboarding Waiver**      | Liability agreements — terms display + agreement checkbox                     |
| **Athlete Testimony**      | Collecting reviews — feedback questions + permission to share                 |
| **Blank Form**             | Custom builds — start with nothing and add exactly what you need              |

<Tip>
  **Start with a template, then customize.** It's faster than building from scratch, and you can add, remove, or edit any field.
</Tip>

## The form builder interface

Once inside the builder, you'll see three areas:

| Area             | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Left sidebar** | Your added fields in order — drag to reorder |
| **Center panel** | Field picker with 5 categories               |
| **Right panel**  | Live preview of your form                    |

<Frame>
  ![Form Builder Example](/images/form-builder-example.png)
</Frame>

**Top bar options:**

- **Settings** — Button colors, multiple response toggle
- **Connections** — Add products, schedulers, or require login
- **Responses** — View submissions (after publishing)
- **Share** — Get your form link
- **Update Form** — Save and publish changes

## Field types reference

Fields are organized into 5 categories. Click a category icon in the center panel to see available fields.

### Contact Info fields

Pre-built fields designed for athlete and parent data. When you require login/signup (in Connections), these fields sync to the athlete's profile in People.

| Field              | What it captures           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Athlete First Name | Athlete's first name       |
| Athlete Last Name  | Athlete's last name        |
| Athlete Email      | Athlete's email address    |
| Athlete Phone      | Athlete's phone number     |
| Athlete Age        | Athlete's age              |
| Parent First Name  | Parent/guardian first name |
| Parent Last Name   | Parent/guardian last name  |

<Note>
  **Profile sync only works when Login/Signup is required.** Without it, Contact Info fields capture data but don't automatically connect to People profiles.
</Note>

### General fields

Content elements that add structure and context to your form — not questions.

| Field                | What it does                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Media                | Embed an image or video                           |
| Heading              | Add a section title                               |
| Plain Text           | Add instructions or descriptions                  |
| Upload File          | Let respondents attach files (PDFs, images, etc.) |
| Description of Terms | Display legal text (for waivers)                  |

### Choices fields

Pre-built selection questions.

| Field    | What it does                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Checkbox | Multiple selections allowed       |
| Yes / No | Binary choice (two radio buttons) |

### Custom fields

Build your own questions with these input types:

| Field         | Best for                       | Example                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Text          | Short answers                  | "What position do you play?"                          |
| Phone         | Phone number input             | Secondary contact number                              |
| Text Area     | Long answers                   | "What are your training goals?"                       |
| Checkbox      | Multiple selections            | "Which days work for you?" (Mon, Tue, Wed...)         |
| Select Box    | Single selection (dropdown)    | "Experience level" (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) |
| Radio Buttons | Single selection (all visible) | "I am the..." (Parent, Athlete)                       |
| Country       | Country selection              | Pre-populated country dropdown                        |

### Templates category

This shows the same template options from form creation — useful if you started blank and want to reference a template's structure.

## Build a form step-by-step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new form">
    Go to **Tools → Forms** and click **\+ Create Form**. Choose a template or start blank. Give your form a name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add fields">
    Click a category in the center panel, then click a field to add it. The field appears in your left sidebar and right preview.

    For custom fields, you'll see a modal to configure:

    - Field type (Text, Select Box, etc.)
    - Label (the question text)
    - Default value (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder fields">
    Drag fields in the left sidebar to change their order. The preview updates automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set required fields">
    Click a field to select it, then mark it as required. Required fields show an asterisk (\*) and must be completed to submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add headings and instructions">
    Use **Heading** fields to create sections (e.g., "Athlete Information", "Parent/Guardian Details"). Use **Plain Text** to add instructions or context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview your form">
    Click the preview button to see exactly what respondents will see. Test the flow before publishing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and publish">
    Click **Update Form** to save. Your form is now live and ready to share.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize form design

Match your form to your brand using the **Settings** menu:

| Setting           | What it controls                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Button Color      | Background color of the submit button |
| Button Text Color | Text color on the submit button       |

<Tip>
  **Use your brand colors.** If your CoachIQ website uses a specific color scheme, match your form buttons for a consistent experience.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  ![Forms Example](/images/forms-example.png)
</Frame>

## Form settings

Access these in the **Settings** dropdown:

### Multiple responses

- **ON** — Same person can submit the form multiple times
- **OFF** — One submission per person (requires login)

Use cases:

- **ON**: Feedback forms, session check-ins
- **OFF**: Registration forms, waivers (one per athlete)

## How connections add pages

When you add Products, Schedulers, or Login/Signup via the **Connections** menu, each becomes a separate page in the form flow:

```
Page 1: Form fields (your questions)
     ↓
Page 2: Login/Signup (if enabled)
     ↓
Page 3: Product payment (if added)
     ↓
Page 4: Scheduler booking (if added)
     ↓
Complete
```

<Note>
  This is the only way to create multi-page forms. There's no manual page break option — the pages come from connections you add.
</Note>

## Form building tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep forms short">
    Every additional field reduces completion rates. Ask only what you need. You can always collect more info later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lead with easy questions">
    Start with simple fields (name, email) before asking longer questions (goals, experience). This builds momentum.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use headings to organize">
    For longer forms, break content into clear sections: "Athlete Info", "Parent Info", "Training Preferences". Makes scanning easier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview before sharing">
    Always preview your form. Check that required fields are marked, questions make sense, and the flow feels natural.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match your website branding">
    Consistent colors build trust. If athletes click a form link from your site, it should feel like the same experience.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What you can't do (yet)

- **Duplicate forms** — Each form must be built individually
- **Conditional logic** — Can't show/hide fields based on answers
- **Manual page breaks** — Multi-page only comes from connections
- **Save partial responses** — Respondents must complete in one session
