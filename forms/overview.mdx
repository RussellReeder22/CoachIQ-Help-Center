Forms are how you collect information from athletes and parents — without the back-and-forth texting, manual data entry, or scattered Google Docs.

<Info>
  **Where to find Forms**: Tools → Forms in the main navigation

## What forms do

A CoachIQ form replaces the messy process of gathering athlete info via text, email, or paper. You create a form once, share the link, and responses flow directly into your system.

Common uses:

- **Lead capture** — "I'm interested in training" inquiries from your website
- **New athlete intake** — Contact info, goals, experience level, parent details
- **Camp/event registration** — Sign up + payment in one step
- **Waivers** — Liability agreements before the first session
- **Feedback** — Post-program surveys or testimonials

## How forms connect to CoachIQ

Forms aren't just data collection — they plug into your entire business system.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="People" icon="users">
    When you require login/signup, form responses automatically appear on the athlete's profile and their data syncs to your People list.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Products" icon="credit-card">
    Add a product to your form to collect payment during submission — perfect for camp fees, registration deposits, or trial session charges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schedulers" icon="calendar">
    Embed a scheduler so athletes can book their first session right after completing your intake form.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automations" icon="bolt">
    Trigger automated actions when a form is submitted — send a welcome message, add a tag, or assign credits.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **How connections work**: When you add Products, Schedulers, or Login/Signup to a form, each becomes a separate page in the submission flow. The athlete completes the form fields first, then proceeds through each connected page.

## Why use CoachIQ forms vs. external tools

You might be used to Google Forms, Typeform, or JotForm. Here's why CoachIQ forms work better for your coaching business:

| External Tools                       | CoachIQ Forms                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Data lives in a separate system      | Data connects to athlete profiles  |
| Manual copy/paste to track responses | Responses appear in one dashboard  |
| Can't collect payments               | Add products for registration fees |
| Can't book sessions                  | Embed schedulers directly          |
| Generic branding                     | Matches your CoachIQ website       |
| No automation triggers               | Triggers automations on submission |

<Tip>
  **The real advantage**: Everything stays in one system. When an athlete submits a form, you don't need to manually add them anywhere — their info, payment, and booking are already connected.

## What you can build with forms

### Lead capture form

Embed on your website to capture interested families. Typical fields: "I am the" (Parent/Athlete), name, email, phone, "How did you hear about us?"

### New athlete onboarding

Collect everything before the first session: contact info, athlete age, experience level, goals, parent details, and a waiver agreement.

### Camp registration with payment

Combine info collection with payment: athlete details, t-shirt size, emergency contact, plus a product for the camp fee.

### Waiver/liability form

Display your terms and require agreement before training begins. When login is required, the signed waiver attaches to their profile.

### Testimonial collection

Request feedback and permission to share on your website. Great for building social proof.

## What forms can't do

Understanding limitations helps you build the right workflows:

- **No conditional logic** — You can't show/hide questions based on previous answers
- **No partial saves** — Athletes must complete the form in one session
- **No form duplication** — Each form is built individually
- **No field-level automation triggers** — Automations trigger on submission, but can't read specific answers (e.g., "if they selected Instagram")
- **No completion analytics** — You see total responses, not drop-off rates
