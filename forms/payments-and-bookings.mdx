Forms become powerful when you connect them to payments and scheduling. Instead of collecting info, then sending a payment link, then asking them to book — do it all in one step.

<Info>
  **Where to find connections**: Open any form in the builder → click **Connections** in the top bar
</Info>

## How connections work

When you add a Product, Scheduler, or Login/Signup to a form, each becomes a separate page in the submission flow:

```
Form Fields → Login/Signup → Payment → Booking → Complete
```

The athlete fills out your questions first, then proceeds through each connected page before finishing.

<Note>
  You control which connections to add. A simple lead form might have none. A camp registration might have all three.
</Note>

## Adding a product (collect payment)

Use this when you want to collect a fee during form submission — registration fees, deposits, camp payments, or trial session charges.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your form">
    Go to **Tools → Forms** and click on the form you want to edit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connections">
    In the top bar, click **Connections** to open the connections menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a product">
    Choose the product you want to attach. This must be a product you've already created in **Payments → Products**.

    The product name, price, and description will display to the athlete during checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your form">
    Click **Update Form** to save. The payment page is now part of your form flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What the athlete sees

After completing your form fields:

1. They're taken to a payment page
2. They see the product name, description, and price
3. They enter payment details
4. After payment, they continue to the next step (or completion)

<Tip>
  **Create a dedicated product for each form use case.** Instead of a generic "Registration Fee", create "Summer Camp 2025 Registration" — clearer for athletes and easier for you to track.
</Tip>

## Adding a scheduler (book a session)

Use this when you want athletes to book a session as part of the form flow — common for evaluation bookings, trial sessions, or onboarding.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your form">
    Go to **Tools → Forms** and click on the form you want to edit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connections">
    In the top bar, click **Connections** to open the connections menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a scheduler">
    Choose the scheduler you want to embed. This must be a scheduler you've already created in **Schedule → Schedulers**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your form">
    Click **Update Form** to save. The booking calendar is now part of your form flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What the athlete sees

After completing previous steps:

1. They see an embedded calendar with your available times
2. They select a date and time
3. After booking, they continue to completion

## Requiring login/signup

Use this when you want form submissions tied to athlete profiles in your People list.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Connections">
    In your form builder, click **Connections** in the top bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Login/Signup">
    Toggle on the login/signup requirement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your form">
    Click **Update Form** to save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What this enables

| With Login/Signup OFF                   | With Login/Signup ON                   |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Anyone can submit anonymously           | Athlete must create account or log in  |
| Data captured but not linked            | Data syncs to their People profile     |
| Can't see submission on athlete profile | Form appears in their activity history |
| No identity verification                | You know exactly who submitted         |

<Note>
  **For waivers, always require login.** You want the signed waiver attached to a specific athlete's profile — not floating anonymously in your responses.
</Note>

## Common connection combinations

### Lead capture form

**Connections:** None

Just collect info. No payment, no booking, no account required. Keep the barrier low for first contact.

### Trial session registration

**Connections:** Login/Signup + Product (trial fee) + Scheduler

Athlete creates account → pays trial fee → books their session. You get a qualified lead with payment commitment and a booking on your calendar.

### Camp registration

**Connections:** Login/Signup + Product (camp fee)

Athlete creates account → pays camp fee. No scheduling needed since camp dates are fixed. Their registration is tied to their profile.

### New athlete onboarding

**Connections:** Login/Signup + Scheduler

Athlete creates account → books first evaluation. No payment at this stage — you'll charge after the eval or via a separate product.

### Waiver collection

**Connections:** Login/Signup only

Athlete creates account → completes waiver. The signed waiver attaches to their profile. No payment or booking needed.

## Viewing connected transactions and bookings

### Payments

When an athlete pays via a form:

- Transaction appears in **Payments → Transactions**
- Shows the product, amount, athlete, and timestamp
- Links to the form submission

### Bookings

When an athlete books via a form:

- Session appears on your **Calendar**
- Shows in the athlete's booking history
- Links to the form submission

### Form responses

All submissions (with or without connections) appear in your form's **Responses** tab.

## Tips for connected forms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create products before building the form">
    You can only connect existing products. Build your registration fee or camp product first in Payments → Products, then add it to your form.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create schedulers before building the form">
    Same logic — you can only connect existing schedulers. Set up your availability and scheduler first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test the full flow yourself">
    Before sharing, submit your own form. Go through every page — fields, login, payment (use test mode if available), and booking. Experience what your athletes will experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep form fields minimal when adding connections">
    Each connection adds a page. If your form already has 15 fields plus payment plus booking, that's a lot of steps. Consider what's truly essential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use login for any form you want tracked">
    Anonymous submissions work, but you lose the profile connection. For anything beyond casual lead capture, require login.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What you can't do

- **Make payment optional** — If a product is connected, payment is required to submit
- **Add multiple products** — One product per form
- **Add multiple schedulers** — One scheduler per form
- **Skip connection pages** — Athletes must complete each connected step in order
