Once your form is built, you need to get it in front of athletes and parents. CoachIQ gives you multiple ways to share — plus control over what happens after someone submits.

<Info>
  **Where to find sharing options**: Open any form in the builder → click **Share** in the top bar
</Info>

## Get your form link

Every form has a unique shareable link.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your form">
    Go to **Tools → Forms** and click on the form you want to share.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Share">
    In the top bar, click **Share** to open the sharing options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the link">
    Copy the direct link to your form. Anyone with this link can access and submit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Where to use the direct link

- Text it to interested parents
- Include in email responses to inquiries
- Add to your Instagram bio or linktree
- Share in Facebook groups or community posts
- Include in printed materials (use a QR code generator)

<Tip>
  **Save your most-used form links.** Keep your lead capture and waiver links handy — you'll share them often.
</Tip>

## Embed on your CoachIQ website

The cleanest way to add forms to your site is using the Form section block in Website Builder.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Website Builder">
    Go to **Website & App → Website Builder**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Form section">
    Click to add a new section and select **Form** from the section types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your form">
    Choose which form to display from your existing forms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and publish">
    Save your website changes. The form now appears directly on your page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Forms embedded on your CoachIQ website inherit your site's styling and feel native to the experience.

## Embed on external websites

If you have a website outside CoachIQ (Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, etc.), you can embed your form there too.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the embed code">
    In the **Share** menu, copy the embed code (iframe snippet).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your external site">
    Paste the embed code into an HTML block or custom code section on your website platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust sizing if needed">
    You may need to adjust the iframe width/height to fit your page layout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Send forms via Inbox

You can send a form link directly to athletes or parents through CoachIQ's Inbox.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Inbox">
    Go to **Inbox** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a message">
    Create a new message or reply to an existing conversation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach or paste the form link">
    Include your form link in the message. Athletes can tap to open and complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Use this for:

- Sending waivers to new signups
- Following up with leads who inquired
- Requesting feedback after a program ends

## Completion actions

Control what happens after someone submits your form.

Access this in the **Settings** menu within your form builder.

| Action              | What happens                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Thank you page**  | Athlete sees a confirmation message (default)  |
| **Redirect to app** | Athlete is sent to your CoachIQ athlete portal |
| **Custom URL**      | Athlete is redirected to any URL you specify   |

<Frame>
  ![Form Redirect](/images/form-redirect.png)
</Frame>

### When to use each

**Thank you page** — Default for most forms. Simple confirmation that submission was received.

**Redirect to app** — Use after onboarding forms. Gets the athlete into your portal where they can explore programs, book sessions, or view content.

**Custom URL** — Use for marketing flows. Redirect to a specific page on your website, a calendar booking link, or a video welcome message.

<Tip>
  **After camp registration, redirect to a "What to Expect" page.** Better experience than a generic thank you.
</Tip>

## Form availability

Your form is live and accessible as soon as you click **Update Form**. There's no separate publish toggle.

To stop accepting submissions:

- Remove the form section from your website, or
- Stop sharing the link

<Note>
  There's no way to "pause" a form while keeping it visible. If you need to stop submissions temporarily, you'll need to remove access to the link.
</Note>

## Sharing tips

  <Accordion title="Use your lead form link everywhere">
    Instagram bio, Facebook page, email signature, business cards. Make it easy for interested families to reach you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Send waivers before the first session">
    Don't wait until they show up. Send the waiver link via Inbox as soon as they book or register.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test your embedded forms">
    After embedding on your website, submit a test response. Make sure the form loads, connections work, and completion action fires correctly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match completion action to the form purpose">
    Lead form → Thank you page (low commitment). Onboarding form → Redirect to app (get them engaged). Camp registration → Custom URL to details page.
