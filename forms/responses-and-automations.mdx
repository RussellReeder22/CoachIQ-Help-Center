After athletes submit your forms, you need to see that data and act on it. This guide covers viewing responses, exporting data, and connecting forms to automations.

<Info>
  **Where to find responses**: Open any form in the builder → click **Responses** in the top bar
</Info>

## Viewing form responses

Every submission is captured in your form's Responses tab.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your form">
    Go to **Tools → Forms** and click on the form you want to review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Responses">
    In the top bar, click **Responses** to see all submissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse submissions">
    You'll see a list of all responses with submission date and respondent info (if login was required).
  </Step>
  <Step title="View individual responses">
    Click any submission to see the complete response — every field and answer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What you see per response

## Exporting responses

Export your form data to CSV for analysis, reporting, or backup.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Responses">
    Navigate to your form's **Responses** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    Click the export button to download all responses as a CSV file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open in spreadsheet">
    Open the CSV in Excel, Google Sheets, or your preferred tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Export regularly for important forms.** Camp registrations, waivers, and lead lists are worth backing up outside CoachIQ.
</Tip>

## How responses connect to People

When you require Login/Signup on a form, submissions link to athlete profiles.

| Login/Signup OFF                      | Login/Signup ON                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Response stored in form only          | Response stored in form AND linked to profile        |
| No profile connection                 | Appears in athlete's activity on their People record |
| Can't see who submitted (anonymous)   | Know exactly which athlete submitted                 |
| Contact Info fields capture data only | Contact Info fields sync to profile                  |

### Viewing form activity on a profile

When login is required:

1. Go to **People → Clients**
2. Click on an athlete
3. View their activity — form submissions appear in their history

<Frame>
  ![Client Form Activity](/images/client-form-activity.png)
</Frame>

This is useful for:

- Confirming a specific athlete signed a waiver
- Seeing all forms an athlete has completed
- Tracking engagement over time

## Automations triggered by forms

Forms can trigger automations when submitted — sending messages, adding tags, or assigning credits automatically.

### What you can do

| Trigger        | What happens                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Form submitted | Automation runs when any submission comes in                               |
| Send message   | Auto-send SMS or in-app message to the respondent                          |
| Add tag        | Automatically tag the athlete (e.g., "Lead", "Camp 2025", "Waiver Signed") |
| Remove tag     | Remove a tag (e.g., remove "Needs Waiver" after waiver submitted)          |
| Add credits    | Assign session credits to the athlete                                      |

### What you can't do

<Warning>
  **Automations can't read specific field answers.** You can trigger an automation when a form is submitted, but you cannot create conditions based on what someone answered.

  For example, you can't build: "If they selected 'Instagram' for 'How did you hear about us?', then add tag 'Instagram Lead'."

  The trigger is submission — not field values.
</Warning>

## Setting up a form automation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Automations">
    Navigate to **Tools → Automations**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new automation">
    Click to create a new automation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select trigger">
    Choose **Form Submitted** as your trigger, then select which form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add actions">
    Configure what happens: send message, add tag, remove tag, add credits, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    Save and activate your automation. It will now run every time that form is submitted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common form automation recipes

### New lead welcome

**Trigger:** Website lead form submitted

**Actions:**

1. Add tag "New Lead"
2. Send SMS: "Thanks for your interest in training! Here's how to book your first session: [link]"

### Waiver signed confirmation

**Trigger:** Waiver form submitted

**Actions:**

1. Add tag "Waiver Signed"
2. Remove tag "Needs Waiver"

### Camp registration follow-up

**Trigger:** Camp registration form submitted

**Actions:**

1. Add tag "Summer Camp 2025"
2. Send in-app message with camp details, schedule, and what to bring

### Post-eval feedback request

**Trigger:** Evaluation feedback form submitted

**Actions:**

1. Add tag "Feedback Received"
2. Send SMS: "Thanks for your feedback! We'd love a Google review if you have a minute: [link]"

<Note>
  **Automations require Login/Signup on the form.** To send messages or add tags, the system needs to know who submitted. Anonymous submissions can't trigger personalized actions.
</Note>

## Response analytics

CoachIQ provides basic response tracking:

| Available                   | Not available            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Total response count        | Completion rate          |
| Individual response details | Drop-off analytics       |
| Submission timestamps       | Field-by-field analytics |
| Export to CSV               | Visual charts/graphs     |

For deeper analysis, export your data and use external tools (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.).

## Tips for managing responses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check responses regularly">
    Don't let leads sit. Check your website form responses daily — those are potential customers waiting to hear from you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use automations to respond instantly">
    A same-day response beats a next-week response. Set up auto-messages so leads hear from you immediately, even if you're coaching.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tag for segmentation">
    Use form automations to tag athletes by source, interest, or status. Later, you can message everyone with a specific tag.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export before deleting">
    If you need to delete a form, export responses first. Once a form is deleted, responses are gone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Require login for anything important">
    Waivers, registrations, onboarding — anything you need tied to a specific athlete should require login. Anonymous responses have limited utility.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
