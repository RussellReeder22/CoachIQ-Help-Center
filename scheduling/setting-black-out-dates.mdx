## What blackout days do

Blackout days are your way of saying "I'm normally available on Wednesdays, but not THIS Wednesday." They block specific dates from your regular availability pattern without deleting or changing your entire schedule.

Think of blackout days as temporary exceptions to your regular coaching schedule.

<Info>
  **Where to find blackout days**: Typically in **Schedule → Schedulers → Edit Scheduler → Availability** or **Unavailability** section
</Info>

## Why blackout days matter

Without blackout days, you'd have two terrible options when taking time off:

**Option 1: Delete your entire availability**

- Then manually recreate it after your vacation
- High risk of errors and forgotten settings
- Time-consuming and frustrating

**Option 2: Let athletes book during time off**

- Then manually cancel each booking
- Upset athletes who already scheduled
- Damaged reputation and trust

**The better way: Blackout days**

- Keep your regular availability intact
- Block specific dates you're unavailable
- Athletes simply don't see those dates as options
- Return from vacation and everything resumes automatically

<Check>
  **Result**: Your calendar stays clean, athletes can't book inappropriate times, and your regular schedule continues seamlessly after time off.

## Blackout days vs other scheduling tools

Understanding what blackout days are (and aren't) helps you use them correctly:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blackout Days">
    **What they do**:

    - Block specific dates from your availability
    - Prevent NEW bookings on those dates
    - Keep your regular schedule intact
    - Temporary exceptions to recurring patterns

    **What they DON'T do**:

    - Cancel existing bookings (you must do this manually)
    - Change your regular availability pattern
    - Notify athletes automatically

    **Best for**:

    - Vacations (multi-day blocks)
    - Holidays (single days)
    - Personal appointments
    - Facility closures
    - Any temporary unavailability
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Editing Availability">
    **What it does**:

    - Changes your regular weekly pattern
    - Affects all future weeks permanently
    - Alters days/times you work

    **What it DOESN'T do**:

    - Block one-off dates
    - Create temporary exceptions

    **Best for**:

    - Changing work schedule permanently
    - Adding or removing regular coaching days
    - Adjusting standard hours
    - Long-term schedule changes
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Canceling Individual Bookings">
    **What it does**:

    - Removes specific booked sessions
    - Notifies affected athletes
    - May refund credits (depending on policy)

    **What it DOESN'T do**:

    - Prevent future bookings on that date
    - Block availability for others

    **Best for**:

    - Emergency cancellations
    - One-off session removals
    - Individual athlete issues
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Blackout days are preventive (stop future bookings), while cancellations are reactive (remove existing bookings). You often need both: add blackout days to prevent new bookings, then cancel any existing bookings during that time.
</Tip>

## How to add blackout days

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your scheduler settings">
    From your dashboard:

    1. Click **Schedule** → **Schedulers**
    2. Find the scheduler you want to block dates for
    3. Click **Edit** or click on the scheduler to open it

    <Frame>
      ![Edit scheduler to access blackout settings](/images/edit-scheduler-for-blackout.png)
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      **Important**: Blackout days are set per-scheduler, not globally. If you have multiple schedulers, you may need to add blackout days to each one individually. (See bulk management section below for easier approach.)
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the blackout days section">
    Scroll through the scheduler settings to find:

    - **Blackout Days**
    - **Unavailable Dates**
    - **Block Dates**
    - **Exceptions**
    - Or similar naming

    This is often near the availability settings or in a separate "Unavailability" section.

    <Frame>
      ![Blackout days section in scheduler](/images/blackout-days-section.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select dates to block">
    Use the date picker or calendar interface to select dates you want to block.

    **Single date selection**:

    - Click one date (e.g., December 25 for Christmas)

    **Date range selection**:

    - Click start date, then end date (e.g., July 10-20 for vacation)
    - Or use "Select Range" option if available

    **Multiple individual dates**:

    - Hold Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) while clicking dates
    - Click each date individually

    <Frame>
      ![Selecting dates in blackout day picker](/images/select-blackout-dates.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **Time-saving tip**: Most systems let you select date ranges. Select your start and end date rather than clicking every single day of a 10-day vacation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add notes (optional but recommended)">
    Some systems let you add notes to blackout days:

    - "Family vacation - Europe"
    - "Gym closed for maintenance"
    - "Doctor appointment"

    **Why add notes**: When you review blackout days later, you'll know why you blocked those dates without having to remember.

    <Frame>
      ![Adding notes to blackout days](/images/blackout-notes.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your blackout days">
    Click **Save**, **Add Blackout**, or **Update Scheduler** to apply these blocks.

    <Check>
      **Success!** The selected dates are now blocked from future bookings. Athletes viewing available times won't see these dates as options.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify in your calendar">
    Navigate to **Schedule → Calendar** and verify:

    - ✅ Blackout dates show no available slots
    - ✅ Days before blackout still have availability
    - ✅ Days after blackout resume normal availability
    - ✅ All intended dates are properly blocked

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar view with blackout days visible](/images/calendar-showing-blackout.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens to existing bookings?

This is the most important thing to understand about blackout days:

<Warning>
  **Critical**: Blackout days only prevent NEW bookings. They do NOT automatically cancel existing bookings during those dates.
</Warning>

### The scenario

**Your situation**:

1. You have regular availability every Monday
2. Athlete already booked Monday, December 18 at 3:00 PM
3. You add blackout days for December 18-22 (vacation)

**What happens**:

- ✅ New bookings for Dec 18-22 are prevented (athletes can't book)
- ❌ Existing booking on Dec 18 at 3:00 PM still exists
- ⚠️ You must manually cancel the Dec 18 booking

### The workflow for time off

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add blackout days FIRST">
    Block the dates you'll be unavailable to prevent new bookings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check calendar for existing bookings">
    Review your calendar during the blackout period:

    - Look for any bookings already scheduled
    - Note which athletes are affected
    - Identify sessions that need canceling
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cancel existing bookings manually">
    For each booking during blackout dates:

    1. Open the booking in your calendar
    2. Cancel the session
    3. Add cancellation reason (optional but professional)
    4. Athlete receives automatic cancellation notification

    <Tip>
      **Communication tip**: Cancel existing bookings as soon as you know about your time off. The more notice athletes get, the less frustration and easier rescheduling.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communicate proactively (optional but recommended)">
    Consider sending a message to affected athletes:

    - "I'll be on vacation Dec 18-22"
    - "Your session during this time has been canceled"
    - "Credits have been refunded to your account"
    - "Let me know if you'd like to reschedule for before/after"

    This professional touch prevents confusion and maintains athlete relationships.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing blackout days across multiple schedulers

If you have multiple schedulers (different session types), you'll need to decide: block all schedulers or just some?

### Scenario 1: Block ALL schedulers (most common)

**Your situation**: You're on vacation—ALL coaching is unavailable.

**Solution**: Add blackout days to every scheduler.

**The tedious way**:

1. Edit Scheduler 1 → Add blackout days
2. Edit Scheduler 2 → Add same blackout days
3. Edit Scheduler 3 → Add same blackout days
4. (Repeat for all schedulers)

**The better way** (if available): Use the **Schedulers Management Dashboard** to add blackout days to multiple schedulers at once.

<Frame>
  ![Managing blackout days across schedulers](/images/bulk-blackout-management.png)
</Frame>

### Scenario 2: Block SOME schedulers

**Your situation**: You're unavailable at Location A but still coaching at Location B.

**Solution**: Add blackout days only to Location A schedulers, leave Location B schedulers active.

**Example**:

- "Downtown Gym Sessions" → Add Dec 18-22 blackout (gym closed for maintenance)
- "West Side Facility Sessions" → No blackout (still operational)

<Note>
  **Strategy tip**: If you have location-specific or context-specific schedulers, blackout days give you flexibility to block some contexts while keeping others active.
</Note>

## Common blackout day uses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vacation Time">
    **Duration**: Multi-day to multi-week blocks

    **How to set**:

    - Select date range: Start date → End date
    - Add to all schedulers (unless doing partial availability)
    - Cancel existing bookings during vacation dates
    - Add note: "Summer vacation" or "Europe trip"

    **Example**: July 10-24 (two weeks off)

    **Pro tip**: Add vacation blackouts as soon as you book the trip, even if it's months away. This prevents problem bookings from piling up.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Holidays">
    **Duration**: Single days or long weekends

    **How to set**:

    - Select specific holiday dates
    - Consider adding day before/after if needed
    - Add to all schedulers
    - Review if any athletes booked before you added the blackout

    **Common holiday blackouts**:

    - Thanksgiving Day + Black Friday
    - Christmas Eve + Christmas Day + Day after
    - New Year's Eve + New Year's Day
    - Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day

    <Tip>
      **Annual planning tip**: When you first set up scheduling, add ALL major holidays for the next year. Save yourself future hassle.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Facility Closures">
    **Duration**: Varies (single day to weeks)

    **How to set**:

    - Add blackout dates to location-specific schedulers only
    - If you have one location, add to all schedulers
    - Communicate closure to athletes proactively

    **Common causes**:

    - Gym maintenance or renovations
    - Building power/HVAC repairs
    - Seasonal closures
    - Lease or rental issues

    **Example**: "Community Center Sessions" scheduler blocked Aug 1-7 for facility renovation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal Appointments">
    **Duration**: Usually single days or partial days

    **How to set**:

    - Select specific date
    - If morning appointment affects afternoon availability, consider blocking just that day
    - Add note for your reference

    **Examples**:

    - Doctor/dentist appointments
    - Family commitments
    - Jury duty
    - Moving day

    <Note>
      **Partial day blocking**: If you have a morning appointment but can coach in afternoon, blackout days may not be the right tool. Instead, consider adjusting your availability start time for just that day using specific date availability.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conference or Training Attendance">
    **Duration**: Multi-day (typically 2-5 days)

    **How to set**:

    - Block conference dates plus travel days if needed
    - Consider blocking day after for recovery/catch-up
    - Add note: "NSCA Conference" or "Certification course"

    **Example**: April 18-21 blocked for coaching certification training

    **Bonus opportunity**: Use conference attendance as content for athlete newsletter or social media ("Leveling up my coaching skills this week!").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weather or Emergency Closures">
    **Duration**: Unexpected, usually 1-3 days

    **How to set**:

    - Add blackout as soon as closure is confirmed
    - Immediately cancel affected bookings
    - Communicate actively with athletes

    **Common causes**:

    - Severe weather (hurricanes, blizzards)
    - Power outages
    - Facility emergencies
    - Public health situations

    <Warning>
      **Emergency tip**: For unexpected closures, speed is critical. Add blackout first (prevents new bookings), then handle cancellations and communication.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Viewing and editing existing blackout days

You'll need to review and modify blackout days as plans change.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access blackout day list">
    Navigate to your scheduler settings:

    1. **Schedule → Schedulers**
    2. Click scheduler to edit
    3. Find **Blackout Days** or **Unavailability** section

    You should see a list of currently active blackout dates.

    <Frame>
      ![List of existing blackout days](/images/view-existing-blackouts.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review upcoming blackout dates">
    Check for:

    - ✅ Dates still relevant
    - ✅ Any dates you can now remove (plans changed)
    - ✅ Missing dates that should be added
    - ✅ Notes/reasons for each blackout

    <Tip>
      **Quarterly review**: Every 3 months, review your blackout days. Remove old ones, add newly planned time off, verify upcoming holidays are blocked.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove outdated blackout days">
    For past blackout dates or changed plans:

    1. Select the blackout date(s) to remove
    2. Click **Delete**, **Remove**, or uncheck the date
    3. Save changes

    <Check>
      **Result**: Those dates will now show available slots again for future weeks (if they're in your regular availability pattern).
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add newly planned time off">
    If you've scheduled new time off:

    1. Select the new dates to block
    2. Add notes if helpful
    3. Save changes
    4. Check calendar for any existing bookings to cancel
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Strategic blackout planning

Smart coaches don't just react to time off—they plan blackout days strategically.

### The annual blackout planning session

**When to do it**: When you first set up scheduling, and then each January

**What to do**:

1. **Add all known holidays** for the year
   - Federal holidays
   - Religious holidays you observe
   - Cultural celebrations
   - Personal important dates (birthdays, anniversaries)
2. **Block planned vacations**
   - Summer vacation
   - Winter break
   - Family trips
   - Already-booked travel
3. **Add recurring personal commitments**
   - Monthly commitments (first Friday of each month)
   - Quarterly events
   - Annual conferences
4. **Build in recovery time**
   - Day after major holidays
   - Day after returning from vacation
   - Post-peak season breaks

<Tip>
  **Time investment**: Spending 30 minutes adding blackout days for the entire year saves hours of booking management and athlete communication throughout the year.
</Tip>

### Buffer blackout days

Consider adding blackout days around major events:

**Travel day philosophy**:

- Block day before departure (packing, preparation, travel)
- Block day after return (unpacking, recovery, jet lag)

**Example**:

- Vacation: July 10-20
- Blackout dates: July 9-21 (includes buffer days)

**Why it matters**: Athletes booking 6:00 AM session on your return day = exhausted coach = poor session quality

### Seasonal considerations

Adjust your blackout strategy by season:

**Summer** (June-August):

- More vacation blackouts
- Holiday weekends (Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day)
- Consider blocking full weeks rather than partial

**Fall** (September-November):

- Thanksgiving week considerations
- School holiday breaks (if relevant)
- Conference season in many sports

**Winter** (December-February):

- Extended holiday blocks (Christmas/New Year's)
- Weather-related emergency availability
- Post-holiday recovery time

**Spring** (March-May):

- Spring break weeks
- Religious holidays (Easter, Passover)
- End-of-school-year commitments

## Communicating blackout days to athletes

Blackout days are internal—athletes don't see a "blocked" day, they just don't see it as available. But proactive communication still helps:

### When to communicate

**Always communicate**:

- ✅ When canceling existing bookings
- ✅ For extended absences (week+)
- ✅ During unexpected closures

**Consider communicating**:

- For holiday closures (reminder)
- For facility maintenance
- When you return from extended time off

**No need to communicate**:

- Every single blackout day
- Short personal appointments
- Single-day closures without existing bookings

### How to communicate

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Individual Messages (Existing Bookings)">
    **When**: You need to cancel their specific booking

    **How**: Send personalized message with cancellation

    **Template**:

    > Hi [Athlete Name],
    >
    > I wanted to let you know that I'll be out of town July 10-20 for a family vacation. Unfortunately, I need to cancel your session scheduled for July 15 at 4:00 PM.
    >
    > Your credit has been refunded to your account and you can rebook for any time after July 21.
    >
    > Sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks for understanding!
    >
    > Coach [Your Name]
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Group Announcements (Extended Absences)">
    **When**: Multi-week vacation or closure affecting many athletes

    **How**: Use CoachIQ's announcement feature

    **Template**:

    > 🏖️ Summer Vacation Notice 🏖️
    >
    > I'll be taking a vacation July 10-20 and won't be offering any sessions during this time.
    >
    > If you had a booking during this period, it's been canceled and your credits have been refunded.
    >
    > I'll resume normal scheduling starting July 21. Book ahead for the week of July 21-27 as spots typically fill up quickly after vacation!
    >
    > See you when I'm back!
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Calendar Notes (Internal Only)">
    **When**: Personal reference, not for athletes

    **How**: Add notes in your calendar or scheduler settings

    **Example notes**:

    - "Doctor appt - morning only"
    - "Gym maintenance 8/1-8/7"
    - "Conference - Vegas"
    - "Family wedding weekend"

    **Why**: Helps you remember why you blocked dates when reviewing months later.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting blackout day issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Athletes can still book during my blackout days">
    **Possible causes**:

    1. Blackout days not saved properly
    2. Blackout added to wrong scheduler
    3. Multiple schedulers exist, only some have blackout
    4. Date selection didn't include all days

    **How to fix**:

    - Re-save blackout days and verify they appear in list
    - Check all schedulers have appropriate blackouts
    - View calendar to verify no slots showing during blackout dates
    - Carefully re-select date range to ensure all days included
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Blackout days disappeared or didn't apply">
    **Possible causes**:

    1. Browser didn't save properly (connection issue)
    2. Selected dates then navigated away without saving
    3. Scheduler was edited afterward and blackouts removed

    **How to fix**:

    - Always click Save/Update after adding blackouts
    - Wait for confirmation message before closing
    - Re-add the blackout dates
    - Consider taking a screenshot after adding blackouts as confirmation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I have existing bookings during blackout dates but forgot to cancel them">
    **Issue**: Blackout days added, but bookings remain

    **How to fix**:

    1. Navigate to calendar
    2. Find all bookings during blackout dates
    3. Cancel each booking manually
    4. Send apology message to affected athletes explaining the oversight
    5. Offer priority rebooking or small goodwill gesture if appropriate

    <Note>
      **Prevention**: Immediately after adding blackout days, check your calendar for existing bookings during those dates and cancel proactively.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Blackout days are blocking too many dates">
    **Issue**: Accidentally selected wrong date range or too many dates

    **How to fix**:

    1. Edit scheduler blackout settings
    2. Remove the problematic blackout dates
    3. Re-add with correct date range
    4. Verify in calendar that proper dates are blocked

    **Common mistake**: Selecting July 1 - August 31 when you meant July 1-7 (week vs. two months).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I need to add blackout days to many schedulers—it's taking forever">
    **Issue**: Tedious to add same blackout dates to 5-10 schedulers individually

    **Solutions**:

    1. **Use Schedulers Management Dashboard** (if available) to bulk-add blackouts
    2. **Consider consolidating schedulers** if they all use same availability anyway
    3. **Set up a system**: Add blackouts to one scheduler first, test, then systematically work through others
    4. **Contact support**: Ask if there's a faster way in your specific CoachIQ version

    <Tip>
      **Future prevention**: When creating new schedulers, immediately add your standard holiday blackouts so you don't have to remember later.
    </Tip>
