## What you'll accomplish

Get your schedulers live in the athlete app so athletes can browse and book sessions. This is the final step after creating your schedulers—making them accessible to athletes.

<Check>
**Success**: Schedulers appear in athlete app, organized clearly, ready for booking.

## The 3-step process

<Steps>

<Note>
**Only see schedulers you've already created.** If a scheduler isn't in the list, create it first in Schedule → Schedulers.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Preview and publish">
Click the **Preview** button to see the athlete view.

Verify:
- Sections appear in the right order
- Scheduler names are clear
- Credit costs display correctly

Changes are live immediately—no publish button needed.

## Organization best practices

**Create sections by:**
- **Service type**: "Private Training" | "Group Classes" | "Assessments"
- **Skill level**: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced"  
- **Program**: "Rising Stars" | "Elite Training" | "Competition Prep"
- **Location**: "Main Gym" | "North Studio" | "Virtual Sessions"

**Order strategically:**
1. Most popular schedulers at the top
2. Free/trial sessions first (lower barrier to entry)
3. Premium services last (after athlete is engaged)

**Keep it simple:**
- 3-5 sections maximum (less overwhelming)
- 2-5 schedulers per section (easy scanning)
- Short section names (2-3 words)

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Think like an athlete—organize by what they're looking for, not by your internal structure. Athletes search by "what I want to do," not "how you categorize it."
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Scheduler created but not appearing in app?">
**Two-step requirement:**
1. Create scheduler (Schedule → Schedulers) ✅
2. Add to athlete app (App Builder → Schedule) ← Don't forget this step!

Creating a scheduler doesn't automatically make it visible to athletes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize how schedulers appear?">
Yes! Click on any scheduler in the app builder to edit:
- Display title (different from scheduler name)
- Description for athletes
- Order within section

[See full customization guide →](/athlete-portal/managing-schedulers)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do all athletes see the same schedulers?">
Yes, currently all athletes see the same scheduler list. To restrict access:
- Use scheduler settings (capacity, prerequisites)
- Create member-tier-specific schedulers
- Use different booking links for different groups
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I remove a scheduler from the app?">
App Builder → Schedule → Click dots menu (⋮) on scheduler → Delete

**Note**: This only removes it from athlete view—the scheduler still exists in your system.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick troubleshooting

**Athletes can't book even though scheduler is in app:**
- Check scheduler is **Active** (Schedule → Schedulers → Edit scheduler)
- Verify availability is configured
- Confirm athlete has required credits/payment method
- Check if capacity is full

**Changes not appearing:**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check in incognito mode
- Verify you clicked outside fields to save changes

**Credit amounts wrong:**
- Credits are set in scheduler settings, not app builder
- Go to Schedule → Schedulers → Edit scheduler → Payment section
