## What a scheduler actually is

A **scheduler** is your bookable service configuration—a template that defines what athletes can book, at what price, with what rules.

Think of a scheduler like a product listing in a store:

- **The product listing** = The scheduler (what's for sale, price, description)
- **Individual items on the shelf** = Available time slots (when it can be purchased)
- **Items in shopping carts** = Bookings (actual purchases)

<Info>
  **Simple definition**: A scheduler is a session type that athletes can book. It defines the "what" (service details) while availability defines the "when" (time windows).
</Info>

## Scheduling terminology in CoachIQ

The biggest source of confusion in CoachIQ scheduling is understanding these three related but different concepts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scheduler">
    **What it is**: The configuration/template for a bookable service

    **What it defines**:

    - Session name and description
    - Duration (30, 45, 60 minutes)
    - Price or credit cost
    - Capacity (1-on-1 or group)
    - Booking rules and limits
    - Which availability it uses

    **Analogy**: A product listing on Amazon

    **Example**: "60-Minute Private Training - \$75 - Max 1 athlete"

    **How many exist**: You create 1-20+ schedulers depending on your business

    **Visibility**: Athletes see scheduler name, description, price when deciding what to book
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Session">
    **What it is**: An available time slot OR a confirmed booking

    **What it includes**:

    - Specific date and time
    - Duration (inherited from scheduler)
    - Which scheduler it came from
    - Participant(s) if booked

    **Analogy**: A specific showing time at a movie theater

    **Example**: "Monday, Oct 2 at 4:00 PM - 60-Minute Private Training"

    **How many exist**: Hundreds or thousands, automatically generated by CoachIQ

    **Visibility**: Athletes see available sessions as time slots they can click to book

    <Note>
      **Confusing part**: "Session" refers to BOTH available time slots (before booking) AND confirmed bookings (after booking). Context determines which meaning.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Booking">
    **What it is**: A confirmed reservation by an athlete for a specific session

    **What it includes**:

    - Athlete name
    - Specific date/time
    - Which scheduler/session type
    - Payment or credit transaction
    - Status (upcoming, past, canceled)

    **Analogy**: A confirmed movie ticket with your name on it

    **Example**: "Jake Smith - Monday, Oct 2 at 4:00 PM - 60-Minute Private Training"

    **How many exist**: Depends on how many athletes book

    **Visibility**: Appears on your calendar and athlete's schedule

    <Check>
      **Key insight**: Booking is a session that has an athlete assigned to it. Before booking, it's an available session. After booking, it's a confirmed booking.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How they work together: The complete flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="You create a scheduler">
    Configure: "60-Minute Private Training"

    - Duration: 60 minutes
    - Price: \$75
    - Capacity: 1 athlete
    - Connected to your M/W/F 3-8 PM availability

    This is the **template** for a bookable service.

    <Frame>
      ![Scheduler configuration screen](/images/create-scheduler-template.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="CoachIQ generates sessions">
    Based on your scheduler + availability, CoachIQ automatically creates bookable time slots:

    **Generated sessions**:

    - Monday, Oct 2 at 3:00 PM
    - Monday, Oct 2 at 4:00 PM
    - Monday, Oct 2 at 5:00 PM
    - Wednesday, Oct 4 at 3:00 PM
    - Wednesday, Oct 4 at 4:00 PM
    - (continues for all M/W/F slots)

    These are **available sessions** (not yet booked).

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar showing available session slots](/images/generated-available-sessions.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **You don't manually create these**: CoachIQ does this math automatically. Your 5-hour availability window + 60-min duration + 15-min buffer = specific number of slots per day.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Athlete views available sessions">
    When athlete visits your booking page, they see:

    - "60-Minute Private Training - \$75"
    - Available times: Oct 2 at 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM...
    - Click a time to book

    <Frame>
      ![Athlete view of available sessions](/images/athlete-booking-view.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Athlete books a session">
    Jake selects Monday, Oct 2 at 4:00 PM and completes booking.

    This creates a **booking** (confirmed reservation):

    - Jake Smith
    - Monday, Oct 2 at 4:00 PM
    - 60-Minute Private Training
    - Paid \$75
    - Status: Upcoming

    <Frame>
      ![Booking appears on calendar](/images/confirmed-booking-calendar.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="That time slot becomes unavailable">
    After Jake's booking:

    - Oct 2 at 4:00 PM is no longer available to other athletes
    - Oct 2 at 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM remain available
    - Your calendar shows Jake's confirmed booking

    <Check>
      **Complete cycle**: Scheduler (template) → Available Sessions (time slots) → Booking (confirmed reservation)
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Visual comparison: Scheduler vs Session vs Booking

| **Aspect**     | **Scheduler**                           | **Session**                         | **Booking**                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **What it is** | Template/configuration                  | Time slot (before or after booking) | Confirmed reservation       |
| **How many**   | 1-20+ per business                      | Hundreds/thousands                  | As many as athletes book    |
| **Created by** | You (coach)                             | CoachIQ (automatically)             | Athlete or coach            |
| **Visibility** | Athletes see when choosing what to book | Athletes see as available times     | Only booked athlete sees    |
| **Example**    | "60-Min Private Training"               | "Monday 4:00 PM"                    | "Jake - Monday 4:00 PM"     |
| **Contains**   | Rules, pricing, duration                | Date/time, from which scheduler     | Athlete name, payment info  |
| **You manage** | Configuration, settings                 | Indirectly via availability         | Cancellations, rescheduling |

<Note>
  **The relationship**: One scheduler generates many sessions. Some sessions become bookings when athletes book them.
</Note>

## Why you need schedulers (not just one "training session")

New coaches often ask: "Why do I need multiple schedulers? Can't I just have one 'Training Session' that athletes book?"

Here's why schedulers matter:

### Reason 1: Different durations need different schedulers

**The problem**: You offer 30-minute, 45-minute, and 60-minute sessions, all at different prices.

**Why one scheduler won't work**:

- A scheduler has ONE duration setting
- Athletes booking "30 minutes" vs "60 minutes" need different options

**Solution**: Create three schedulers:

- "30-Minute Quick Session - \$50"
- "45-Minute Standard Session - \$70"
- "60-Minute Deep Dive - \$90"

**Result**: Athletes choose their preferred duration, you charge appropriately.

### Reason 2: Different pricing requires different schedulers

**The problem**: You charge 75 for private sessions & 40 for group sessions.

**Why one scheduler won't work**:

- A scheduler has ONE price
- Different session types have different value

**Solution**: Create separate schedulers:

- "Private 1-on-1 Session - \$75"
- "Small Group Session - \$40 per person"

**Result**: Correct pricing, clear differentiation.

### Reason 3: Different capacities need different schedulers

**The problem**: Private sessions allow 1 athlete, group sessions allow 6 athletes.

**Why one scheduler won't work**:

- A scheduler has ONE capacity setting
- Can't have both "max 1" and "max 6" in same scheduler

**Solution**: Different schedulers per format:

- "Private Training - 1 athlete max"
- "Small Group Training - 6 athletes max"

**Result**: Proper capacity management, no overbooking.

### Reason 4: Different services have different rules

**The problem**: Free assessments have no cancellation restrictions, paid sessions require 24-hour notice.

**Why one scheduler won't work**:

- A scheduler has ONE set of booking rules
- Different services warrant different policies

**Solution**: Service-specific schedulers:

- "Free Assessment - No cancellation restrictions"
- "Paid Session - 24hr cancellation required"

**Result**: Appropriate policies per service type.

<Check>
  **Bottom line**: Schedulers give you the flexibility to offer diverse services with different configurations. One scheduler = one set of rules. Multiple services = multiple schedulers.
</Check>

## When to create multiple schedulers

Use this decision framework to determine if you need a new scheduler:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Different Duration → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Offering 30-min, 45-min, AND 60-min sessions
    - Half-day vs full-day training camps
    - Quick check-ins vs comprehensive sessions

    **Example**:

    - "30-Min Technique Check - \$45"
    - "60-Min Complete Training - \$80"
    - "2-Hour Intensive Session - \$150"

    **Why**: Duration is locked per scheduler, so different durations require different schedulers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Different Pricing → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Different price points for different value levels
    - Premium vs standard offerings
    - Introductory vs regular pricing

    **Example**:

    - "Intro Session - \$50 (First-timers only)"
    - "Standard Session - \$75"
    - "Elite Training - \$125 (Advanced athletes)"

    **Why**: Each scheduler has one price, so price variations require separate schedulers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Different Capacity → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Private (1-on-1) vs group sessions
    - Small group (2-4) vs large group (10-20)
    - Semi-private (2 athletes) vs open class

    **Example**:

    - "Private 1-on-1 - Max 1 athlete"
    - "Semi-Private - Max 2 athletes"
    - "Group Class - Max 10 athletes"

    **Why**: Capacity setting is per scheduler, so different group sizes need different schedulers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Different Service Type → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Distinct services with different purposes
    - Assessment vs ongoing training
    - Specialty services requiring unique descriptions

    **Example**:

    - "Initial Assessment & Goal Setting"
    - "Strength & Conditioning Session"
    - "Speed & Agility Training"
    - "Video Analysis Session"

    **Why**: Different services deserve different descriptions and branding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Different Availability → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Some services only offered certain days/times
    - Location-specific services
    - Seasonal offerings

    **Example**:

    - "Weekday Private Sessions" (M-F availability)
    - "Weekend Bootcamp" (Sat/Sun only)
    - "Summer Camp Sessions" (June-August only)

    **Why**: If availability genuinely differs, separate schedulers let you configure each appropriately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Different Coach/Trainer → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Athletes choose specific coaches
    - Coaches have different pricing or specialties
    - Clear attribution matters

    **Example**:

    - "Training with Coach Mike - \$75"
    - "Training with Coach Sarah - \$75"
    - "Youth Training with Coach Emma - \$60"

    **Why**: Coach-specific schedulers provide clarity and enable proper attribution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Different Booking Rules → New Scheduler">
    **Create separate schedulers when**:

    - Cancellation policies differ
    - Booking limits vary
    - Some services require different minimum notice

    **Example**:

    - "Drop-In Class - Cancel anytime" (flexible)
    - "Premium Private - 24hr cancellation required" (strict)

    **Why**: Booking rule configuration is per scheduler.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When NOT to create separate schedulers

Don't create multiple schedulers when:

❌ **Same service, different athletes**

- Bad: "Session for Jake", "Session for Sarah"
- Better: One "Private Training" scheduler that all athletes book

❌ **Same everything except date**

- Bad: "October Sessions", "November Sessions"
- Better: One scheduler with ongoing availability

❌ **Minor description variations**

- Bad: "Hitting Practice", "Batting Practice" (same service, different words)
- Better: One "Hitting/Batting Practice" scheduler

❌ **You just want organization**

- Bad: Creating 10 schedulers to categorize types
- Better: Use program groupings for organization

❌ **Different athletes should pay different amounts**

- Bad: "Premium Athlete Session", "Standard Athlete Session"
- Better: One scheduler with custom pricing at booking time OR use access codes

<Warning>
  **Scheduler bloat**: Creating too many schedulers confuses athletes and makes your system harder to manage. Only create a new scheduler when there's a functional difference in duration, price, capacity, or rules.
</Warning>

## Real coaching examples: How many schedulers?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Jake (Solo Trainer) - 3 Schedulers">
    **Business**: Personal training, early career, building client base

    **Schedulers**:

    1. **"Free 30-Min Assessment"**
       - Duration: 30 minutes
       - Price: Free
       - Purpose: Convert leads to paying clients
    2. **"60-Minute Private Training - \$75"**
       - Duration: 60 minutes
       - Price: \$75 direct payment OR 1 credit
       - Purpose: Main service offering
    3. **"45-Minute Follow-Up Session - \$60"**
       - Duration: 45 minutes
       - Price: \$60
       - Purpose: Lower-cost option for check-ins

    **Why this works**: Simple, clear options for athletes. Three distinct value propositions. Easy to manage.

    <Frame>
      ![Three schedulers for solo trainer](/images/jake-solo-trainer-schedulers.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sarah (Youth Coach) - 5 Schedulers">
    **Business**: Youth sports development, group and private options

    **Schedulers**:

    1. **"Private Skills Training (Ages 8-12) - \$65"**
       - Duration: 45 minutes
       - Capacity: 1 athlete
       - Purpose: Individualized youth training
    2. **"Small Group Session (Ages 8-12) - \$35/athlete"**
       - Duration: 60 minutes
       - Capacity: 4 athletes max
       - Purpose: Peer learning environment
    3. **"Private Advanced Training (Ages 13-18) - \$80"**
       - Duration: 60 minutes
       - Capacity: 1 athlete
       - Purpose: Older athlete development
    4. **"Team Practice Session (Priced per team)"**
       - Duration: 90 minutes
       - Capacity: 15 athletes
       - Purpose: Team training contracts
    5. **"Parent Consultation - Free"**
       - Duration: 30 minutes
       - Price: Free
       - Purpose: Parent communication, athlete progress

    **Why this works**: Age-appropriate segmentation, clear group vs private distinction, relationship-building with parents.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mike (Facility Owner) - 12+ Schedulers">
    **Business**: Multi-coach facility, diverse services, 100+ athletes

    **Schedulers organized by categories**:

    **Private Training (3 schedulers)**:

    - "Private with Coach Mike - \$100" (60 min)
    - "Private with Coach Sarah - \$90" (60 min)
    - "Private with Any Coach - \$80" (60 min)

    **Small Group (2 schedulers)**:

    - "Semi-Private (2 Athletes) - \$60/each" (60 min)
    - "Small Group (3-5 Athletes) - \$45/each" (60 min)

    **Group Classes (4 schedulers)**:

    - "Strength & Conditioning Class - \$30" (60 min, max 12)
    - "Speed & Agility Class - \$30" (45 min, max 10)
    - "Youth Development Class - \$25" (60 min, max 15)
    - "Weekend Bootcamp - \$40" (90 min, max 20)

    **Specialty Services (3 schedulers)**:

    - "Video Analysis Session - \$75" (45 min)
    - "Initial Assessment - \$50" (60 min)
    - "Nutritional Consultation - \$100" (60 min)

    **Why this works**: Clear service differentiation, coach-based pricing, multiple price points serve different budgets, specialty services highlighted.

    <Tip>
      **Organization tip**: Mike uses program groupings to organize these 12 schedulers into "Private Training," "Group Classes," and "Specialty Services" so athletes aren't overwhelmed.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Scheduler naming best practices

The name athletes see matters. Good naming helps athletes understand what they're booking instantly.

### Formula for effective scheduler names

**Pattern 1: Duration + Service + Price**

- "60-Min Private Training - \$75"
- "30-Min Quick Session - \$45"
- "90-Min Intensive Training - \$120"

**Pattern 2: Service + Details + Price**

- "Small Group Strength Class (Max 8) - \$30"
- "1-on-1 Speed Development - \$85"
- "Team Practice Session - Contact for pricing"

**Pattern 3: Service + Coach + Price**

- "Private Training with Coach Mike - \$90"
- "Youth Development with Coach Emma - \$60"
- "Speed Training with Coach Sarah - \$80"

**Pattern 4: Service + Age/Level + Price**

- "Youth Skills (Ages 8-12) - \$50"
- "Advanced Training (High School+) - \$85"
- "Beginner Strength Class - \$25"

### What to include in scheduler names

**Always include**:

- ✅ Clear service type (what they're getting)
- ✅ Price or "Free" (no surprises)
- ✅ Duration (if not obvious from context)

**Consider including**:

- Coach name (if coach-specific)
- Age range or skill level (if service is targeted)
- Group size or capacity (if relevant to value)
- Location (if you have multiple facilities)

**Avoid**:

- ❌ Internal codes ("PT-60-A")
- ❌ Vague terms ("Session 1")
- ❌ Overly long descriptions (save for description field)
- ❌ All caps or excessive punctuation

<Tip>
  **Test your names**: Show your scheduler names to someone unfamiliar with your business. Can they understand what each scheduler is within 3 seconds? If not, simplify.
</Tip>

## Common scheduler mistakes

<Warning>
  **Avoid these common pitfalls:**
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating too many schedulers">
    **Mistake**: 20+ schedulers with minor variations

    **Problem**: Athletes overwhelmed by choices, can't decide what to book

    **Example of excess**:

    - "Monday Morning Session"
    - "Tuesday Morning Session"
    - "Wednesday Morning Session"
    - (Separate scheduler per day)

    **Better approach**: One "Morning Training Session" with availability covering all morning days

    **Rule of thumb**: If the only difference is WHEN (not what/price/rules), don't create separate schedulers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating too few schedulers">
    **Mistake**: One "Training Session" for everything

    **Problem**: Can't differentiate pricing, capacity, or duration

    **Example of inadequate**:

    - Only "Training Session" but you offer 30-min, 60-min, private, and group

    **Better approach**: At minimum:

    - "30-Min Private - \$50"
    - "60-Min Private - \$85"
    - "Group Class - \$30"

    **Rule of thumb**: If services have different prices, durations, or capacities, they need separate schedulers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Poor naming conventions">
    **Mistake**: "Session A", "PT-1", "Training 60"

    **Problem**: Athletes don't understand what they're booking

    **Why it happens**: Using internal shorthand instead of customer-facing language

    **Better approach**:

    - "60-Minute Private Training"
    - "Small Group Strength Class"
    - "Free Assessment Session"

    **Rule of thumb**: If athlete's grandparent couldn't understand the name, it's too unclear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not organizing schedulers">
    **Mistake**: 10+ schedulers in random order with no categorization

    **Problem**: Athletes scroll through unorganized list, analysis paralysis

    **Better approach**: Use program groupings:

    - "Private Training" group (3 schedulers)
    - "Group Classes" group (4 schedulers)
    - "Specialty Services" group (2 schedulers)

    **Rule of thumb**: Once you have 5+ schedulers, implement program groupings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inconsistent scheduler configuration">
    **Mistake**: Same service type but different settings across schedulers

    **Example**:

    - "Private Training - Coach Mike" has 15-min buffer
    - "Private Training - Coach Sarah" has 30-min buffer
    - Causes scheduling conflicts and confusion

    **Better approach**: Standardize settings across similar schedulers

    - All private sessions: 15-min buffer
    - All group classes: 20-min buffer
    - All assessments: 30-min buffer

    **Rule of thumb**: Create configuration standards and document them.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How schedulers connect to other CoachIQ features

Schedulers don't exist in isolation—they integrate with the broader platform:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Availability" icon="calendar-check">
    **Connection**: Schedulers pull from availability templates

    **Relationship**: One availability template can power multiple schedulers

    **Example**: "Weekday Availability" powers both "30-Min Session" and "60-Min Session" schedulers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Products & Payment" icon="credit-card">
    **Connection**: Schedulers link to payment products or credit packages

    **Relationship**: Scheduler specifies which product athletes must purchase or how many credits to redeem

    **Example**: "Private Training" scheduler charges 1 credit OR \$75 direct payment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calendar" icon="calendar-alt">
    **Connection**: Booked sessions from schedulers appear on calendar

    **Relationship**: Each booking shows which scheduler it came from

    **Example**: Calendar displays "Jake - 60-Min Private Training - 3:00 PM" (scheduler name visible)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credits" icon="coins">
    **Connection**: Schedulers specify credit cost per booking

    **Relationship**: Scheduler determines how many credits are deducted when athlete books

    **Example**: "Premium Session" costs 2 credits, "Standard Session" costs 1 credit
  </Card>
  <Card title="Website Builder" icon="desktop">
    **Connection**: Embed specific schedulers on your website

    **Relationship**: Choose which schedulers appear on which website pages

    **Example**: Homepage shows "Free Assessment", Services page shows all paid schedulers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Athlete Portal/App" icon="mobile-alt">
    **Connection**: Athletes view and book schedulers through portal

    **Relationship**: Schedulers appear as bookable options in athlete's app

    **Example**: Athlete opens app, sees all schedulers they're eligible to book
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reminders" icon="bell">
    **Connection**: Configure automated reminders per scheduler

    **Relationship**: Each scheduler has its own reminder settings

    **Example**: "Premium Sessions" get 24-hour reminder, "Group Classes" get 1-hour reminder
  </Card>
  <Card title="Programs" icon="folder-open">
    **Connection**: Group schedulers into logical categories

    **Relationship**: Program groupings organize multiple schedulers for easier athlete navigation

    **Example**: "Private Training" program contains 3 related schedulers
  </Card>
