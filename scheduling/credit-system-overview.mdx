<Info>
  **New to credits?** Think of them like punch cards or arcade tokens—athletes buy credits upfront, then redeem them for sessions instead of paying each time.
</Info>

## What are credits?

Credits are a **pre-paid booking currency** that athletes purchase in packages and redeem when booking sessions with you. Instead of paying $50 each time they book, an athlete might buy a "10-Credit Package" for $450 upfront, then use 1 credit per session.

**Real-world analogy**: Like a gym membership punch card or Starbucks rewards—pay once, use credits multiple times.

### The basic credit flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Athlete purchases credits">
    Athlete buys a credit package from you:

    - "10-Credit Package - \$450"
    - "20-Credit Package - \$800"
    - "Monthly Unlimited - 8 Credits/month"

    **Result**: Credits added to athlete's account balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Athlete books sessions">
    When booking, athlete chooses to pay with credits:

    - Selects "60-Min Private Training" (costs 1 credit)
    - Clicks "Book with Credits" instead of paying \$50
    - 1 credit deducted from their balance

    **Result**: Session booked, credit consumed, athlete has 9 credits remaining
  </Step>
  <Step title="Athlete uses remaining credits">
    Athlete continues booking sessions using their credit balance:

    - Books again next week (8 credits left)
    - Books again (7 credits left)
    - Continues until credits run out

    **Result**: Predictable booking experience, no payment friction each time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Athlete runs out, buys more">
    When credits run low, athlete purchases another package:

    - Receives low-balance notification
    - Buys new 10-credit package
    - Balance replenished, continues training

    **Result**: Recurring revenue cycle established
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why use credits instead of direct payment?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Your Business">
    **Financial benefits:**

    ✅ **Upfront cash flow**: Get paid $450 today instead of $50 × 10 over 10 weeks\
    ✅ **Higher commitment**: Athletes who buy packages stick around longer (80%+ retention vs 50% pay-per-session)\
    ✅ **Predictable revenue**: Know exactly how much money is "in the bank" via sold credits\
    ✅ **Reduced transaction fees**: 1 transaction for 10 sessions instead of 10 separate charges\
    ✅ **Package discounts**: Sell 10 credits for $450 ($45/credit) vs $50 per session—athlete saves $50, you secure \$450 upfront

    **Operational benefits:**

    ✅ **Faster booking**: No payment processing at booking time (credit already owned)\
    ✅ **Fewer no-shows**: Athletes less likely to waste pre-paid credits\
    ✅ **Flexible offerings**: Different credit packages for different athlete types\
    ✅ **Easier refunds**: Refund credits instead of money (keeps cash in business)\
    ✅ **Subscription compatibility**: Combine with monthly credit subscriptions for recurring revenue

    <Check>
      **Bottom line**: Credits improve cash flow, increase retention, and reduce administrative overhead.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Athletes">
    **Why athletes love credits:**

    ✅ **Cost savings**: Package discounts (buy 10, save \$50)\
    ✅ **Simplified booking**: No payment step at booking time\
    ✅ **Commitment tool**: Helps them stay accountable (already paid)\
    ✅ **Flexibility**: Use credits across different session types\
    ✅ **Gift-friendly**: Can purchase as gifts or receive from others\
    ✅ **Progress tracking**: Visual credit balance = training progress

    **Example athlete experience:**

    "I bought a 20-credit package for $800 in January. Every time I book, it just asks how many credits to use—no entering my card info repeatedly. I can see I have 12 credits left, which motivates me to keep training. When I run low, I just buy another package. So much easier than paying $50 every single session!"

    <Tip>
      **Marketing angle**: Position credit packages as "better value" and "convenient commitment tool"—athletes respond well to both benefits.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Common Misconceptions">
    **What credits are NOT:**

    ❌ **Not a membership fee**: Credits are used per booking, not monthly access\
    ❌ **Not automatic**: Athletes choose when to use credits (not auto-deducted)\
    ❌ **Not restrictive**: Can offer both credit-based AND direct-payment options\
    ❌ **Not complicated**: Athletes understand "tokens" and "punch cards" intuitively\
    ❌ **Not required**: You can run entire business without credits if preferred

    **Addressing concerns:**

    "_Won't athletes get confused?_"\
    → No more than gym memberships or coffee rewards—familiar concept

    "_What if athletes don't use all their credits?_"\
    → Set expiration dates, send low-balance reminders, offer rollover policies

    "_Isn't this risky? I'm giving sessions before getting paid!_"\
    → Opposite—you GET PAID FIRST, then deliver sessions. Better cash flow than pay-per-session.
  </Tab>

## How credits work in CoachIQ

### Credit packages (Products)

Credits are sold through **Products** in CoachIQ's payment system. There are two ways to issue credits:

**Product Types That Issue Credits:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Payment Products">
    **How it works**: Single purchase, all credits issued immediately

    **Example**: "10-Credit Package - \$450"

    - Athlete pays \$450 once
    - Receives 10 credits instantly
    - Uses credits until depleted
    - Purchases another package when ready

    **Best for**: Pay-as-you-go coaching, flexible commitments, trial packages

    **Configuration**: Create product → Enable "Add credits once purchased" → Set credit amount
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subscription Products">
    **How it works**: Recurring payment, credits issued per billing cycle

    **Example**: "Monthly Membership - \$250/month (5 credits/month)"

    - Athlete pays \$250 monthly
    - Receives 5 fresh credits each month
    - Credits may expire or roll over (your choice)
    - Auto-renews as long as subscription active

    **Best for**: Predictable recurring revenue, committed athletes, membership models

    **Configuration**: Create subscription → Set frequency (Month/Week/Year) → Enable "Add credits once purchased" → Set credits per cycle

    **Special feature**: Can set "Unlimited credits" for subscription period (displays as `∞` symbol)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**What athlete receives:**

- Credits added to their account balance immediately after purchase
- Ability to use credits when booking schedulers that accept them
- Credit balance tracked in Athlete Portal and mobile app

<Note>
  **Important**: You create credit-issuing products in **Payments → Products**, then configure schedulers to accept those credits in **Schedule → Schedulers**. It's a two-way linkage—both sides must be configured.
</Note>

---

### Two types of credits

CoachIQ has two distinct credit types that work together:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Master Credits (Universal)">
    **What they are**: Credits that can be used for ANY credit-enabled scheduler

    **How they work:**

    - No restrictions on which sessions they can book
    - Used LAST (after scheduler-specific credits are exhausted)
    - Displayed as "Master Credits" in athlete profile

    **When to issue:**

    - General-purpose credit packages
    - Flexibility for athlete to book any service
    - Simple credit system without restrictions

    **Athlete sees**:

    - "Master Credits: 10"
    - "These credits can be used for any session and have no restrictions"

    <Check>
      **Most common**: If you're starting with credits, use Master Credits for simplicity.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scheduler-Specific Credits">
    **What they are**: Credits restricted to designated schedulers only

    **How they work:**

    - Can ONLY be used for specific sessions you select
    - Used FIRST (before master credits)
    - Displayed with "Redeemable Sessions" list showing which schedulers accept them

    **When to issue:**

    - Membership packages for specific programs
    - Tiered offerings (Basic members get Class A only, Premium get all classes)
    - Revenue sharing with other coaches (restrict to their sessions)

    **Configuration**: In product builder → "Redeemable Schedulers" → Select specific schedulers

    **Athlete sees**:

    - "5 Credit Rising Stars Membership"
    - "Redeemable Sessions: Rising Stars Class (0/∞), Rising Stars Shooting Lab (0/∞)"

    **Use case example**: "Elite Program Membership" grants 10 credits/month but they can only book Elite Class and Elite Shooting Labs—not your basic training sessions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Credit Priority System:** When athlete books a session, CoachIQ checks credits in this order:

1. **First**: Scheduler-specific credits for that particular scheduler
2. **Last**: Master credits (if scheduler-specific exhausted or don't exist)

<Tip>
  **Strategic use**: Combine both types—sell general packages (master credits) and premium memberships (scheduler-specific credits) to create tiered offerings.
</Tip>

---

### Credit-enabled schedulers

Once athletes have credits, they need schedulers configured to accept them.

**Scheduler pricing options:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Credit-Only">
    **Configuration**: Session costs 1 credit (or 2, or 3, etc.)

    **Athlete requirement**: Must have credits to book (no direct payment option)

    **When to use**:

    - Package-deal businesses
    - Want to enforce credit purchases
    - Simplify booking (credits only, no payment decisions)

    **Example**: "60-Min Private Training - 1 Credit"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid (Credit OR Direct Payment)">
    **Configuration**: Session costs 1 credit OR \$50 direct payment

    **Athlete choice**: Use credit if they have one, or pay \$50 if they don't

    **When to use**:

    - Offer flexibility to new athletes
    - Allow drop-ins without forcing package purchase
    - Maximize booking opportunities

    **Example**: "60-Min Private Training - 1 Credit OR \$50"

    <Tip>
      **Best practice**: Price direct payment higher than credit-equivalent to incentivize package purchases. (1 credit = $45 value, but direct payment = $50)
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Direct Payment Only">
    **Configuration**: Session costs \$50 (no credit option)

    **Athlete requirement**: Must pay per session

    **When to use**:

    - Trial/assessment sessions (don't want credits used here)
    - Specialty services separate from regular training
    - One-off workshops or events

    **Example**: "Initial Consultation - \$75" (no credits accepted)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Free">
    **Configuration**: Session is free

    **No payment or credits required**

    **When to use**:

    - Lead magnets
    - Courtesy sessions for VIP athletes
    - Community events

    **Example**: "Free Assessment Session"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Credit balance and tracking

**Where athletes see their balance:**

- **Athlete Portal dashboard**: Prominent credit display on homepage
- **Mobile app home screen**: Current balance at top
- **Billing settings page**: Complete credit management hub
- **Booking flow**: Balance shown before confirming session
- **Email notifications**: Low balance alerts

**Athlete's Billing Settings Page includes:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Available Credits section">
    Lists all active credit sources:

    - "10-Credit Package" - Balance: 6 credits
    - "Monthly Membership" - Balance: ∞ (unlimited this period)
    - "Master Credits" - Balance: 3 credits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit Renewals">
    Shows when subscription credits renew:

    - "10/18/2025 (active)"
    - Indicates next billing date for credit refresh
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit Expirations">
    Tracks expiring credits:

    - "10/18/2025 (0/5)"
    - Meaning: 0 credits expired out of 5 total issued
    - Helps athletes know if they need to use credits soon
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Redeemable Sessions">
    Shows which schedulers accept current credits:

    - "Rising Stars Class: 0/∞" (unlimited available for this scheduler)
    - "Elite Class: 0/∞" (unlimited available for this scheduler)
    - "Private Sessions: 6" (6 finite credits available)

    **Per-scheduler tracking**: Each scheduler shows individual usage if restricted credits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Membership(s)">
    Active subscriptions that issue credits:

    - "Monthly Rising Stars Membership - \$250/month"
    - Next renewal date and status
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit Logs">
    Complete transaction history:

    - Date | Amount | Source
    - "04 Aug, 7:46 AM | -1 Credits | Redeemed for Rising Stars Class"
    - "22 May, 10:07 AM | +10 Credits | Purchased 10-Credit Package"
    - "08 Jul, 5:53 PM | +13 Credits | Set by [Coach Name]" (manual grant)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**What coaches see:**

- Individual athlete credit balances (in athlete profile → Credits tab)
- Separate tabs for each credit source (Master Credits tab, product-specific tabs)
- Total credits outstanding (all athletes combined)
- Credit usage trends and analytics
- Low-balance athletes (proactive outreach opportunity)

---

### Understanding credit display notation

Athletes will see specific symbols and formats in their credit balance:

| Symbol    | Meaning                      | Explanation                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`6`**   | 6 finite credits             | Standard credit balance—use until depleted                       |
| **`∞`**   | Unlimited credits            | Unlimited WITHIN current subscription period (resets at renewal) |
| **`3/∞`** | Used 3 of unlimited          | Used 3 credits this period, unlimited remaining until renewal    |
| **`0/∞`** | Scheduler-specific available | Shows per-scheduler usage for restricted credits                 |
| **`0/5`** | Expiration tracking          | 0 credits expired out of 5 total issued                          |
| **`0`**   | No credits remaining         | Balance empty—need to purchase or wait for subscription renewal  |

<Warning>
  **Common confusion**: `∞` does NOT mean unlimited forever. It means unlimited WITHIN the current billing period. For monthly subscriptions, unlimited credits reset each month.
</Warning>

**Examples in context:**

**Scenario 1: One-time package**

- Athlete bought "10-Credit Package"
- Display: "Credit Balance: 6"
- Meaning: 6 credits remaining from original 10

**Scenario 2: Monthly subscription**

- Athlete has "Unlimited Monthly Membership"
- Display: "Credit Balance: ∞"
- Meaning: Can book unlimited sessions this month, resets next month

**Scenario 3: Subscription with usage**

- Athlete used 3 sessions from monthly unlimited
- Display: "Credit Balance: 3/∞"
- Meaning: Used 3 this month, unlimited remaining until renewal

**Scenario 4: Scheduler-specific credits**

- Athlete has "Rising Stars Membership"
- Display under Redeemable Sessions:
  - "Rising Stars Class: 0/∞"
  - "Rising Stars Shooting Lab: 0/∞"
- Meaning: Unlimited bookings for these specific classes this month

## Credit package strategy

### Pricing your packages

**The discount formula:**

Calculate your per-session price, then offer tiered discounts based on package size.

**Example pricing structure:**

| Package            | Credits | Price   | Per-Credit Cost | Discount |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Pay-Per-Session    | N/A     | \$50    | \$50.00         | 0%       |
| 5-Credit Starter   | 5       | \$240   | \$48.00         | 4% off   |
| 10-Credit Standard | 10      | \$450   | \$45.00         | 10% off  |
| 20-Credit Premium  | 20      | \$850   | \$42.50         | 15% off  |
| 50-Credit Elite    | 50      | \$2,000 | \$40.00         | 20% off  |

**Why this works:**

- Small discount for small package = low barrier to entry
- Larger discount for larger package = incentive to commit
- Pay-per-session stays highest price = drives package sales

<Tip>
  **Sweet spot**: 10-credit packages are most popular. Price aggressively here (10-15% discount) to drive volume.
</Tip>

---

### Package sizing recommendations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="5-Credit Starter Package">
    **Best for**: New athletes, trial periods, testing your service

    **Typical duration**: 2-3 weeks (2x/week training)

    **Pricing strategy**: Small discount (5-8% off)

    **Why it works**: Low commitment, easy "yes" for trying you out

    **Example**: "\$240 for 5 Credits - Try before you commit!"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="10-Credit Standard Package">
    **Best for**: Most athletes, 1-2 month commitments

    **Typical duration**: 5 weeks (2x/week) or 10 weeks (1x/week)

    **Pricing strategy**: Meaningful discount (10-12% off)

    **Why it works**: Enough sessions to see results, not overwhelming commitment

    **Example**: "\$450 for 10 Credits - Our most popular package!"

    <Check>
      **Recommended**: Make this your flagship package. Most coaches sell 60-70% of credits in 10-packs.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="20-Credit Premium Package">
    **Best for**: Committed athletes, 2-3 month programs

    **Typical duration**: 10 weeks (2x/week) or 20 weeks (1x/week)

    **Pricing strategy**: Strong discount (15% off)

    **Why it works**: Serious commitment, positions athlete as dedicated

    **Example**: "\$850 for 20 Credits - Best value for committed athletes!"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unlimited Monthly Subscription">
    **Best for**: High-frequency athletes, predictable revenue

    **Structure**: Fixed monthly fee, set number of credits per month (e.g., \$400/month = 12 credits)

    **Pricing strategy**: Significant savings for frequent athletes

    **Why it works**: Predictable recurring revenue, athlete locks in

    **Example**: "\$400/month Unlimited - 12 Credits/month (up to 3x/week)"

    See [Subscription Scheduling](/scheduling/subscription-scheduling) for full details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced credit concepts

### Credit expiration

**Should credits expire?** Depends on your business model.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="No Expiration (Recommended for Most)">
    **Policy**: Credits never expire

    **Benefits**:

    - Athlete-friendly, removes pressure
    - Simpler to manage
    - No refund disputes
    - Better for seasonal athletes (ski coaches, summer camps)

    **Drawback**: Athletes might not use credits for months/years

    **Best for**: Building goodwill, long-term athlete relationships
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="6-Month Expiration">
    **Policy**: Credits expire 6 months after purchase

    **Benefits**:

    - Encourages regular training
    - Prevents "credit hoarders"
    - Aligns with typical program lengths

    **Communication required**: Clear expiration warnings at purchase and via email

    **Best for**: High-frequency training businesses, regular weekly schedules
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rolling Expiration">
    **Policy**: Credits expire 90 days from LAST USE (not purchase)

    **Benefits**:

    - Rewards active athletes (credits stay fresh with use)
    - Gently discourages inactive athletes
    - Fair compromise

    **Best for**: Coaches who want to encourage consistency without being harsh
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Legal note**: Some jurisdictions have laws about stored value/gift card expiration. Check local regulations before setting expiration policies.
</Warning>

---

### Credit refunds and transfers

**Common scenarios:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Athlete wants refund on unused credits">
    **Your options:**

    1. **Full refund**: Return unused credits as money (minus transaction fees)
    2. **Partial refund**: Refund minus a processing/admin fee
    3. **No refunds**: Credits are final sale (most common)
    4. **Credit freeze**: Pause expiration for athlete on extended break

    **Recommended policy**: "No refunds on credit packages, but credits never expire and can be gifted to others."

    **Why**: Protects your cash flow, maintains simplicity
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete wants to transfer credits to friend">
    **Your options:**

    1. **Allow transfers**: Build goodwill, potential new athlete acquisition
    2. **No transfers**: Protect against credit resale market
    3. **Conditional transfers**: Allow with admin fee or approval

    **Recommended**: Allow transfers with coach approval—turns athletes into referral sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coach cancels session, credit already used">
    **Standard practice**: Refund credit back to athlete's balance

    **System should handle automatically**: CoachIQ refunds credits when coach cancels

    **No cash refund needed**: Credit goes back into athlete's account for future use
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Multi-credit sessions

**When to use multiple credits per session:**

✅ **Longer sessions**: 90-min session = 1.5 credits or 2 credits\
✅ **Premium services**: Video analysis session = 2 credits\
✅ **Group training value**: Small group (max 4) = 1 credit, but individual value maintained\
✅ **Specialty add-ons**: Nutrition consult = 0.5 credits

**Configuration in CoachIQ:**

- Set scheduler to require 2 credits (or 1.5, 0.5, etc.)
- System automatically deducts correct amount at booking
- Athlete sees credit cost before confirming

**Example tiered structure:**

- 30-min session = 0.5 credits
- 60-min session = 1 credit
- 90-min session = 1.5 credits
- 120-min intensive = 2 credits

---

### Credit-based vs subscription scheduling

**Understanding the difference:**

| Feature                 | Credit Packages            | Subscriptions                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Payment**             | One-time upfront           | Recurring monthly                          |
| **Credit delivery**     | All at once                | Monthly allotment                          |
| **Athlete flexibility** | Use anytime until depleted | Use within month or lose                   |
| **Revenue model**       | Lumpy (package purchases)  | Predictable (monthly)                      |
| **Commitment level**    | Medium (10-20 sessions)    | High (ongoing monthly)                     |
| **Best for**            | Most coaches               | Established businesses with loyal athletes |

**Can combine both**: Offer packages for some athletes, subscriptions for others.

See [Subscription Scheduling](/scheduling/subscription-scheduling) for full comparison.

## Credit system best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    **First 3 months**: Offer just TWO packages:

    - 5-Credit Starter (\$240)
    - 10-Credit Standard (\$450)

    **Why**: Test demand, keep operations simple, learn pricing

    **Expand later**: Add larger packages once you understand athlete buying patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Price to Incentivize" icon="percentage">
    **Make packages clearly better** than pay-per-session:

    - 10% discount minimum
    - 15-20% for large packages

    **Psychology**: Athlete should feel "stupid" not buying package if they'll train regularly

    **Example**: $50/session vs $450/10-pack ($45/session) = $50 savings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate Value" icon="bullhorn">
    **At every touchpoint**, remind athletes of credit value:

    - "You're saving \$5 per session with your package!"
    - "9 credits remaining—book your next session!"
    - "Low balance alert—buy now and save!"

    **Result**: Reinforces smart purchase decision, encourages renewals
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automate Low-Balance Alerts" icon="bell">
    **Set up notifications** when athlete hits:

    - 3 credits remaining
    - 1 credit remaining
    - 0 credits (out of stock)

    **Include**: Direct link to purchase more credits

    **Result**: Proactive renewals, prevents "I forgot to buy more" booking failures
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track Credit Economics" icon="chart-line">
    **Monitor monthly**:

    - Credits sold (how much cash came in)
    - Credits used (how many sessions delivered)
    - Outstanding credit liability (credits sold but not used)

    **Goal**: Credits sold ≥ credits used = healthy cash flow

    **Warning sign**: Credits used \> credits sold = burning through old sales
  </Card>
  <Card title="Seasonal Adjustments" icon="calendar-alt">
    **Back-to-school (Sept)**: Offer bonus credits (buy 10, get 1 free)

    **New Year (Jan)**: Promote 20-packs for "commitment month"

    **Summer slowdown**: Offer "no expiration" messaging to keep summer credits

    **Result**: Maintain cash flow during seasonal dips
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if athlete books but doesn't have enough credits?">
    **System behavior**: CoachIQ prevents booking if insufficient credits

    **Athlete sees**: "You need 1 credit to book. Purchase credits to continue."

    **Your action**: None required (system handles automatically)

    **Best practice**: Send low-balance alerts proactively to prevent this
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I offer both credits AND direct payment for same session?">
    **Yes!** This is the "hybrid" model.

    **Configuration**: Set scheduler to accept "1 Credit OR \$50"

    **Athlete experience**: Chooses payment method at booking time

    **Why do this**: Flexibility for new athletes, while incentivizing packages for regulars
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do credits work with recurring bookings?">
    **Important**: Credits are NOT auto-deducted when creating recurring bookings

    **How it works**:

    - Coach creates recurring pattern (12 sessions)
    - System checks athlete has 12 credits available (validates)
    - Credits deducted per your configuration (at booking time OR at session time)

    **Scenario to avoid**: Athlete has 12 credits, you book 12 recurring sessions, then athlete uses credits elsewhere—now they're out of credits for the recurring sessions.

    See [Recurring Bookings](/scheduling/recurring-bookings) for full details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I round credits to whole numbers?">
    **Recommendation**: Yes, keep it simple

    **Acceptable**: 1 credit, 2 credits, 5 credits

    **Avoid**: 1.5 credits, 0.75 credits (confusing for athletes)

    **Exception**: If you offer 30-min sessions alongside 60-min, consider 0.5 credits for 30-min to maintain proportional pricing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes share/split credit packages?">
    **Your policy decision**:

    **Option 1**: No sharing (default)—each athlete has their own credit balance

    **Option 2**: Family/couple accounts—allow credit sharing among linked accounts

    **CoachIQ default**: Individual credit balances per athlete

    **Workaround for sharing**: Create "family package" product that grants credits to multiple athlete accounts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to unused credits if athlete stops training?">
    **Financially**: This is your profit margin buffer

    **Explanation**: Some unused credits offset administrative costs, marketing, and credit card fees

    **Typical unused rate**: 10-20% of credits go unused (industry standard)

    **To minimize**:

    - Send re-engagement campaigns to inactive athletes
    - Offer credit transfer to friends
    - Allow gifting unused credits
    - No expiration policy keeps athletes willing to return later
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Master Credits and Scheduler-Specific Credits?">
    **Master Credits:**

    - Universal—can be used for any credit-enabled scheduler
    - Used LAST (after scheduler-specific credits exhausted)
    - Simple, flexible, great for starting out

    **Scheduler-Specific Credits:**

    - Restricted to designated schedulers only
    - Used FIRST (priority over master credits)
    - Great for tiered memberships and program-specific packages

    **Strategic use**: Combine both to create simple packages (master credits) and premium memberships (scheduler-specific credits) in the same business.

## Decision guide: Should you use credits?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Great fit for credits">
    **Your business has these traits:**

    ✅ You want upfront cash flow\
    ✅ You offer packages or programs (not just drop-ins)\
    ✅ Athletes train regularly (2+ times per month)\
    ✅ You want higher commitment from athletes\
    ✅ You're comfortable with package sales conversations\
    ✅ You can handle some administrative overhead (credit tracking)

    **Athlete types that love credits:**

    - Committed long-term athletes
    - Athletes on structured programs
    - Those who value convenience
    - Package/deal shoppers

    **Verdict**: Credits will improve your business metrics
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Maybe skip credits">
    **Your business has these traits:**

    ❌ You offer primarily drop-in/casual sessions\
    ❌ Athletes train inconsistently (monthly or less)\
    ❌ You prefer simplicity over optimization\
    ❌ Your athletes are very transient (tourists, travelers)\
    ❌ You're just starting out and want to test demand first

    **Athlete types that struggle with credits:**

    - Drop-in athletes
    - Tourists/travelers (won't use credits)
    - Very casual trainers
    - Those with unpredictable schedules

    **Verdict**: Start with direct payment, add credits later if needed
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid approach">
    **Best of both worlds:**

    ✅ Offer credit packages for committed athletes\
    ✅ Allow direct payment for casual/new athletes\
    ✅ Price direct payment higher to incentivize packages\
    ✅ Transition athletes from pay-per-session → packages over time

    **Implementation:**

    1. Start all new athletes on direct payment (try you out)
    2. After 4-6 sessions, offer credit package as "better value"
    3. Frame it as reward for their commitment
    4. Gradually shift athlete base toward packages

    **Verdict**: Recommended for most coaches—flexibility + revenue optimization
