## What you'll accomplish

Master the advanced configuration settings that protect your time, prevent over-booking, manage cancellations, and ensure fair athlete access to your sessions. These settings transform a basic scheduler into a business-optimized booking system.

<Check>
  **Success criteria**: Your scheduler has capacity limits that prevent overbooking, booking rules that ensure fair access, cancellation policies that protect your revenue, and buffer times that prevent burnout.
</Check>

## Before you begin

<Note>
  **Required**: You must have at least one scheduler already created. This article covers settings you configure AFTER scheduler creation. If you haven't created a scheduler yet, see [Creating Your First Scheduler](/scheduling/creating-first-scheduler).
</Note>

**Recommended preparation**:

- Think about your ideal booking policies
- Consider past booking problems you've experienced
- Have examples of athlete behavior you want to encourage/prevent
- Know your capacity limits and time constraints

## Why scheduler settings matter

These aren't just technical configurations—they're business protection mechanisms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Revenue Protection" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Without proper settings**: Athletes book then cancel last-minute, leaving empty slots you can't fill

    **With proper settings**: 24-hour cancellation policy gives you time to rebook, protecting revenue

## Setting 1: Session capacity

Control how many athletes can book the same time slot.

### What it does

**Session capacity** sets the maximum number of athletes who can book a single time slot from this scheduler. This is a scheduler-level setting that applies to ALL sessions generated from this scheduler.

**Critical limitation**: You CANNOT set different capacities for individual time slots. If you need different capacities, you must create separate schedulers.

### Configuration options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Private Sessions">
    **Setting**: Max 1 athlete per slot

    **When to use**:

    - 1-on-1 personal training
    - Private coaching sessions
    - Individual assessments
    - High-touch services requiring full attention

    **Example**:

    - "60-Min Private Training" scheduler
    - Capacity: 1 athlete
    - Result: Only one athlete can book 3:00 PM slot

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Even if you occasionally train 2 athletes together, keep this at 1 athlete for private schedulers. Manually book the second athlete when needed rather than allowing double-booking.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Small Group">
    **Setting**: Max 2-6 athletes per slot

    **When to use**:

    - Semi-private training
    - Small group classes
    - Partner sessions
    - Limited accountability groups

    **Example**:

    - "Small Group Strength Class" scheduler
    - Capacity: 6 athletes
    - Result: Up to 6 athletes can book the same 5:00 PM class

    **Decision framework**:

    - 2 athletes = Truly semi-private, high attention
    - 4 athletes = Small group, moderate attention
    - 6 athletes = Larger group, less individual focus

    <Note>
      **Quality consideration**: More athletes = less individual attention. Choose capacity based on service quality you can maintain, not just space available.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Large Group">
    **Setting**: Max 10-20+ athletes per slot

    **When to use**:

    - Group fitness classes
    - Team training sessions
    - Workshops and clinics
    - Community events

    **Example**:

    - "Sunday Bootcamp Class" scheduler
    - Capacity: 20 athletes
    - Result: Up to 20 athletes can book the same Sunday 9:00 AM slot

    **Facility owner considerations**:

    - Set capacity based on SAFE numbers, not just space
    - Consider equipment availability
    - Account for coach-to-athlete ratio
    - Leave buffer for walk-ins if applicable

    <Warning>
      **Safety first**: Never exceed capacity your insurance covers or facility regulations allow. Set scheduler capacity BELOW your true maximum to account for unexpected attendance.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Common capacity mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setting capacity too high for service quality">
    **Mistake**: "Small group training" with 10-athlete capacity

    **Problem**: Can't give adequate attention to 10 athletes, service quality suffers

    **Fix**:

    - True small group = 4-6 athletes max
    - If you want 10 athletes, call it "Group Class" and adjust pricing
    - Create separate "Small Group - 6 max" and "Large Group - 10 max" schedulers

    **Rule of thumb**: If you can't remember everyone's name mid-session, capacity is too high for "small group."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One capacity for multiple service types">
    **Mistake**: One "Training Session" scheduler with 6-athlete capacity used for both private and group

    **Problem**:

    - Athletes book thinking it's private
    - 5 other athletes show up
    - Confusion and disappointment

    **Fix**: Create separate schedulers:

    - "Private Training - 1 athlete max"
    - "Group Training - 6 athletes max"

    **Why this matters**: Clear expectations = happy athletes = better retention
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not accounting for no-shows">
    **Mistake**: Facility has room for 25, set capacity to 25

    **Problem**:

    - If 25 book and 5 no-show, only 20 attend (you're counting on this)
    - But one week all 25 show up, facility is over capacity

    **Fix**:

    - If facility safely holds 25, set capacity to 20-22
    - Build in buffer for unexpected full attendance
    - Never rely on no-shows to manage capacity

    <Warning>
      **Legal liability**: Over-capacity situations can violate insurance, fire codes, and regulations. Always err on the side of fewer athletes.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Capacity decision framework

Use this guide to set appropriate capacity:

| Service Type      | Recommended Capacity | Reasoning                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Private 1-on-1    | 1 athlete            | Full attention, personalized coaching |
| Semi-private      | 2 athletes           | Partnership dynamic, shared cost      |
| Small group       | 4-6 athletes         | Group energy, individual attention    |
| Large group       | 10-15 athletes       | Class format, general instruction     |
| Team training     | 15-25 athletes       | Team dynamics, multiple coaches       |
| Workshops/clinics | 20-50+ athletes      | Educational format, demo-based        |

## Setting 2: Booking limits per athlete

Prevent individual athletes from monopolizing your schedule.

### What it does

**Booking limits** control how many sessions a single athlete can book within a timeframe (per day or per week). This ensures fair access when slots are limited and demand is high.

**Use case**: You have limited availability. Without limits, one enthusiastic athlete books 5 sessions per week, preventing others from training with you.

### Configuration options

<Steps>
  <Step title="Max bookings per day">
    **Setting**: Maximum times one athlete can book in a single day

    **Common options**:

    - **1 booking** = Most common for private training
    - **2 bookings** = Allows morning + evening for dedicated athletes
    - **Unlimited** = No restrictions

    **When to use**:

    - Private training: Set to 1 (one session per day max)
    - Group classes: Set to 2 (allows athlete to attend multiple classes per day)
    - Open gym: Unlimited (athletes can book multiple time blocks)

    **Example scenario**:

    - Scheduler: "60-Min Private Training"
    - Limit: 1 booking per day
    - Result: Athlete can only book one private session per day, even if multiple slots available

    <Tip>
      **Why this matters**: Prevents athlete from booking morning session, then booking evening session, taking two slots from other athletes who might want one.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Max bookings per week">
    **Setting**: Maximum times one athlete can book in a 7-day rolling period

    **Common options**:

    - **1 booking** = Once-per-week programs
    - **2-3 bookings** = Standard training frequency
    - **5 bookings** = Intensive programs
    - **Unlimited** = No restrictions

    **When to use different limits**:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Starter Coaches (Jake)">
        **Recommended**: 2-3 bookings per week

        **Reasoning**:

        - You have limited slots (maybe 20-30 per week)
        - 10 athletes × 2 sessions = 20 slots filled
        - Leaves room for new athlete acquisition
        - Prevents dependence on one athlete

        **Example**:

        - "Private Training" scheduler
        - Limit: 2 bookings per week
        - Result: Athlete can book Monday + Wednesday, but not Friday (would be 3rd)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Scaling Coaches (Chris)">
        **Recommended**: 3-5 bookings per week OR tiered system

        **Reasoning**:

        - More capacity available (40-60 slots/week)
        - Can offer intensive programs
        - May have VIP tier with unlimited access

        **Tiered approach**:

        - "Standard Training" scheduler = 2 bookings/week
        - "Premium Training" scheduler = 5 bookings/week
        - "Elite Unlimited" scheduler = No limits

        **Result**: Monetize higher-frequency training while protecting availability
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Facility Owners (Mike)">
        **Recommended**: Vary by scheduler type

        **Configuration example**:

        - Drop-in classes = No weekly limit (encourage frequent attendance)
        - Private training = 3 bookings/week (fair access to limited coaches)
        - Specialty programs = 5 bookings/week (intensive program structure)

        **Reasoning**: Different services have different capacity constraints and business goals
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="No limits (unlimited bookings)">
    **When to use unlimited**:

    - Open gym time (want athletes to book as much as they want)
    - Group classes with large capacity (24+ athletes)
    - Workshops/events (first-come-first-served)
    - You have excess capacity and want to maximize bookings

    **When NOT to use unlimited**:

    - Private training with limited slots
    - High-demand schedulers
    - When you're already at capacity
    - Small group sessions (6 or fewer athletes)

    <Warning>
      **Unlimited risk**: One athlete could theoretically book your entire week. Only use unlimited when you have high capacity or want to maximize that athlete's engagement.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Booking limits decision tree

```
Do you have limited availability (under 30 slots/week)?
├─ Yes → Set weekly limits (2-3 bookings/week)
└─ No → Continue

Is this high-demand training (waitlist common)?
├─ Yes → Set weekly limits (2-3 bookings/week)
└─ No → Continue

Is this private 1-on-1 training?
├─ Yes → Set daily limit (1 booking/day) + weekly limit (2-3/week)
└─ No → Continue

Is this large group class (15+ capacity)?
├─ Yes → Consider unlimited (encourage frequent attendance)
└─ No → Set moderate limits (3-5 bookings/week)
```

### Real-world booking limit examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: Solo trainer with limited slots">
    **Context**: Jake has 25 available slots per week, 15 active athletes

    **Problem without limits**: 3 athletes book 5 sessions each = 15 slots filled, other 12 athletes can't train

    **Solution**:

    - Set limit: 2 bookings per week
    - Result: 15 athletes × 2 sessions = up to 30 bookings possible
    - Fair distribution, room for new athletes

    **Settings**:

    - Max per day: 1 booking
    - Max per week: 2 bookings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example 2: Facility with tiered memberships">
    **Context**: Mike's facility has 3 membership levels

    **Configuration**:

    - **Basic Membership** scheduler = 2 bookings/week
    - **Standard Membership** scheduler = 4 bookings/week
    - **Unlimited Membership** scheduler = No limits

    **Result**: Monetizes frequency, athletes self-select based on training goals

    **Key insight**: Use separate schedulers for different membership tiers rather than one scheduler with complex rules
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example 3: High-demand group class">
    **Context**: Chris runs a popular small group class (6 athlete max), always full

    **Problem without limits**: Same 6 athletes book every class, new athletes can't join

    **Solution**:

    - Set limit: 3 bookings per week
    - Result: Regular athletes get 3 classes, but must leave spots for others

    **Alternative**: Create VIP unlimited scheduler at higher price

    - "Small Group Class - Standard" = 3/week limit, \$40/session
    - "Small Group Class - Unlimited VIP" = No limits, \$50/session

    **Result**: Fair access + premium tier for dedicated athletes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting 3: Cancellation policies

Control when and how athletes can cancel bookings.

### What it does

**Cancellation policies** determine:

1. **CAN** athletes cancel? (Yes/no)
2. **WHEN** can they cancel? (Anytime, 24-hour notice, 48-hour notice, never)
3. **WHAT HAPPENS** to credits? (Refund or forfeit)

### Policy options explained

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Allow Anytime Cancellation">
    **Setting**: Athletes can cancel up until session start time

    **Pros**:

    - Maximum athlete flexibility
    - Reduces no-shows (better to cancel than not show up)
    - Lower friction for new athletes hesitant to commit

    **Cons**:

    - Last-minute cancellations hard to fill
    - Revenue loss if you can't rebook
    - May enable flaky behavior

    **When to use**:

    - Free sessions or trials
    - New athlete onboarding
    - Low-demand schedulers with easy rebooking
    - Community events

    **Example**: "Free Assessment Session" - allow anytime cancellation to reduce barriers to trying you out
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="24-Hour Cancellation Notice">
    **Setting**: Athletes must cancel 24+ hours before session

    **Pros**:

    - Gives you time to rebook the slot
    - Balances athlete flexibility with business protection
    - Industry standard for personal training
    - Reduces frivolous bookings

    **Cons**:

    - Some athletes forget about 24-hour window
    - Emergency situations still happen

    **When to use**:

    - Private training (most common)
    - Small group sessions
    - Standard paid services
    - When you have waitlists or high demand

    **Example**: "60-Min Private Training" - 24-hour notice allows you to contact waitlist or offer slot to another athlete

    <Tip>
      **Best practice**: 24-hour notice is the sweet spot for most coaching businesses. It protects your revenue while being fair to athletes with legitimate schedule changes.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="48-Hour Cancellation Notice">
    **Setting**: Athletes must cancel 48+ hours (2 days) before session

    **Pros**:

    - More time to rebook
    - Stronger commitment from athletes
    - Better for weekend sessions (requires Wednesday cancellation)

    **Cons**:

    - Less flexible for athletes
    - May discourage bookings
    - Can feel strict for new athletes

    **When to use**:

    - High-demand sessions with long waitlists
    - Weekend or evening prime slots
    - Specialty services requiring prep
    - VIP/premium tier services

    **Example**: "Saturday Morning Elite Class" - 48-hour notice required because weekend slots are hardest to fill last-minute
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No Cancellations Allowed">
    **Setting**: Once booked, athlete cannot cancel (booking is final)

    **Pros**:

    - Guarantees revenue
    - Maximum schedule protection
    - Reduces no-shows (athlete knows credit/payment is lost)

    **Cons**:

    - Very inflexible
    - May prevent bookings
    - Poor athlete experience
    - Emergency situations still require you to make exceptions

    **When to use**:

    - Special events or workshops
    - Limited capacity specialty sessions
    - Sessions requiring significant prep/materials
    - One-time intensive programs

    **Example**: "Competition Prep Workshop" - No cancellations due to catering order, materials prep, and venue commitment

    <Warning>
      **Use sparingly**: No-cancellation policies should be rare and clearly communicated. Most athletes will find this too restrictive for regular training.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Credit refund settings

When using credit-based schedulers, decide what happens to credits on cancellation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Refund credits on cancellation (Recommended)">
    **How it works**: When athlete cancels within policy window, credit returns to their balance

    **Example**:

    - Policy: 24-hour cancellation with credit refund
    - Athlete books Friday 3pm session (costs 1 credit)
    - Thursday 2pm: Athlete cancels (more than 24 hours notice)
    - Result: 1 credit returns to athlete's balance, can rebook later

    **When to use**:

    - Standard training relationships
    - Monthly subscription credits
    - To encourage bookings without fear of wasting credits
    - When you want flexibility for loyal athletes

    **Business impact**: More bookings (athletes less afraid to try), but requires managing rebooking
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No credit refund (Credits forfeited)">
    **How it works**: If athlete cancels, credit is consumed regardless (no refund)

    **Example**:

    - Policy: 24-hour cancellation, no credit refund
    - Athlete books Friday 3pm session (costs 1 credit)
    - Thursday 2pm: Athlete cancels
    - Result: 1 credit is GONE (forfeited), athlete must use another credit to rebook

    **When to use**:

    - Last-minute cancellation situations (under 24 hours)
    - To discourage flaky behavior
    - Premium or limited-capacity sessions
    - When no-shows are a significant problem

    **Business impact**: Fewer cancellations (athletes committed), but may discourage initial bookings

    <Warning>
      **Be careful**: Forfeiting credits on legitimate cancellations damages athlete relationships. Reserve this for late cancellations or chronic offenders.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid approach (Best practice)">
    **Configuration**:

    - **Cancellations WITH proper notice** (24+ hours) = Credit refunded
    - **Late cancellations** (under 24 hours) = Credit forfeited
    - **No-shows** = Credit forfeited + possible penalty

    **Why this works**:

    - Fair to athletes who plan ahead
    - Protects your business from last-minute changes
    - Industry standard

    **Implementation**: Most platforms enforce this automatically based on your policy settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Cancellation policy decision framework

Choose your policy based on these factors:

| Factor              | Lenient Policy                     | Strict Policy                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Demand**          | Low demand, easy to rebook         | High demand, waitlist common     |
| **Business stage**  | New business, building clientele   | Established, protecting capacity |
| **Service type**    | Free/trial sessions                | Premium paid sessions            |
| **Relationship**    | New athletes                       | Long-term committed athletes     |
| **Competition**     | High competition, need flexibility | Unique service, high value       |
| **No-show history** | Rare no-shows                      | Frequent no-show problems        |

**Recommended starting point**: 24-hour cancellation with credit refund, adjust based on athlete behavior

---

## Setting 4: Buffer time

Create breathing room between back-to-back sessions.

### What it does

**Buffer time** adds automatic padding before and/or after each session to prevent back-to-back scheduling. This gives you time for:

- Setup and cleanup
- Notes and documentation
- Bio breaks and hydration
- Mental reset between athletes
- Travel time (if mobile training)

**Critical insight**: Buffer time is invisible to athletes. They only see their session time. The buffer blocks booking slots adjacent to their session.

### Configuration options

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buffer BEFORE session">
    **Setting**: Minutes blocked before session start

    **Use cases**:

    - Setup time for equipment
    - Review athlete notes/goals
    - Mental preparation
    - Travel time from previous location

    **Common durations**:

    - 5 minutes = Quick review and setup
    - 10 minutes = Standard preparation
    - 15 minutes = Travel time between locations

    **Example**:

    - Session: 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM (60 min)
    - Buffer before: 10 minutes
    - Result: 2:50 PM - 3:00 PM is blocked, can't be booked
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buffer AFTER session">
    **Setting**: Minutes blocked after session end

    **Use cases**:

    - Cleanup and equipment reset
    - Session notes and athlete updates
    - Cool-down and recovery
    - Running-over buffer (sessions that might go long)

    **Common durations**:

    - 5 minutes = Minimal cleanup
    - 10 minutes = Standard reset time
    - 15 minutes = Thorough cleanup + notes

    **Example**:

    - Session: 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM (60 min)
    - Buffer after: 15 minutes
    - Result: 4:00 PM - 4:15 PM is blocked, next session can start at 4:15 PM earliest
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buffer BOTH before and after">
    **Setting**: Combine both buffers for maximum protection

    **When to use**:

    - High-intensity sessions requiring full reset
    - Mobile training (travel time both ways)
    - Complex setup/cleanup requirements
    - Maximum burnout prevention

    **Example configuration**:

    - Session: 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM (60 min)
    - Buffer before: 10 min
    - Buffer after: 10 min
    - Result: 2:50 PM - 4:10 PM blocked (80 minutes total)

    **Effective session length**: 60-min session + 20-min buffer = 80 minutes per athlete

    <Tip>
      **Pricing consideration**: If your effective time is 80 minutes, price accordingly even though athlete only sees "60-minute session"
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Buffer time strategy by coaching style

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Studio-Based Training">
    **Typical setup**: Athletes come to your facility

    **Recommended buffer**:

    - Before: 5 minutes (quick review and setup)
    - After: 10 minutes (cleanup, notes, reset)
    - Total: 15-minute buffer

    **Reasoning**: Minimal travel, controlled environment, efficient turnaround

    **Schedule example**:

    - 6:00 AM - 7:00 AM: Athlete 1 (with 5 min before, 10 min after)
    - 7:15 AM - 8:15 AM: Athlete 2 (with 5 min before, 10 min after)
    - Effective: 4 sessions in 4.5 hours
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mobile Training">
    **Typical setup**: You travel to athlete locations

    **Recommended buffer**:

    - Before: 15-20 minutes (travel time)
    - After: 10 minutes (pack up, notes)
    - Total: 25-30 minute buffer

    **Reasoning**: Must account for travel between locations

    **Schedule example**:

    - 6:00 AM - 7:00 AM: Athlete 1 (at Location A)
    - 7:35 AM - 8:35 AM: Athlete 2 (at Location B) - 35 min for travel + setup
    - Effective: 2 sessions in 3 hours

    <Note>
      **Pro tip**: Group athletes by geographic area to minimize buffer time. Schedule all north-side athletes Monday, south-side Tuesday, etc.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Online/Virtual Training">
    **Typical setup**: Video call sessions

    **Recommended buffer**:

    - Before: 5 minutes (tech check, review notes)
    - After: 5-10 minutes (session notes, reset)
    - Total: 10-15 minute buffer

    **Reasoning**: No travel, but need mental reset between calls

    **Schedule example**:

    - 6:00 AM - 6:45 AM: Athlete 1 (45-min virtual)
    - 7:00 AM - 7:45 AM: Athlete 2 (15-min buffer = time for notes + coffee)
    - Effective: 2 sessions in 2 hours

    **Zoom fatigue prevention**: Consider 15-minute buffers for back-to-back virtual sessions to prevent burnout
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="High-Intensity/Specialty">
    **Typical setup**: Demanding sessions requiring full recovery

    **Recommended buffer**:

    - Before: 10 minutes (mental prep, specific setup)
    - After: 20 minutes (thorough cleanup, detailed notes, recover)
    - Total: 30-minute buffer

    **When to use**:

    - Competition prep sessions
    - Assessment/evaluation sessions
    - One-on-one skill development requiring focus
    - When you need mental reset between athletes

    **Schedule example**:

    - 6:00 AM - 7:30 AM: Athlete 1 (60-min session + 30-min buffer)
    - 8:00 AM - 9:30 AM: Athlete 2
    - Effective: 2 sessions in 3.5 hours

    **Why worth it**: Quality over quantity, prevent burnout, maintain high coaching standards

### Common buffer time mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No buffer time at all">
    **Mistake**: Back-to-back sessions with zero buffer

    **Problems**:

    - Constant rushing between athletes
    - No time for notes or documentation
    - Burnout and exhaustion
    - Can't handle sessions that run over
    - No time for emergencies or bio breaks

    **Fix**: Minimum 5-10 minute buffer after every session

    **Long-term impact**: Preventing burnout is worth the slight reduction in daily capacity
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buffer time too short for reality">
    **Mistake**: 5-minute buffer for mobile training requiring 15-minute drive

    **Problem**: Constantly running late, stressed, unprofessional

    **Fix**: Time yourself for one week, add 5-minute cushion to that average

    **Example**:

    - Average drive: 12 minutes
    - Buffer needed: 12 min + 5 min cushion = 17 minutes
    - Set before-session buffer to 20 minutes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inconsistent buffer across schedulers">
    **Mistake**:

    - "Morning Sessions" = 10-min buffer
    - "Evening Sessions" = 5-min buffer
    - Causes scheduling chaos and confusion

    **Fix**: Standardize buffer time across all schedulers of same type

    - All private sessions = 10-min after buffer
    - All group classes = 15-min after buffer (more cleanup)
    - All assessments = 20-min after buffer (detailed notes)

    **Why**: Consistency = predictable schedule = less stress
  </Accordion>

## Setting 5: Scheduling windows

Control WHEN athletes can book (how far in advance).

### What it does

**Scheduling windows** set two time boundaries:

1. **Minimum notice**: Earliest athletes can book before session (prevents last-minute bookings)
2. **Maximum future booking**: Latest athletes can book in advance (controls booking horizon)

### Minimum booking notice

**Purpose**: Prevent last-minute bookings that disrupt your schedule

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="No minimum notice">
    **Setting**: Athletes can book up until session starts

    **When to use**:

    - Drop-in classes or open gym
    - Flexible schedule with real-time availability
    - Low-demand times you want to fill
    - When you WANT last-minute bookings

    **Pros**: Maximizes bookings, fills last-minute cancellations **Cons**: Difficult to plan your day, may not see booking in time

    **Example**: "Open Gym Access" - Athletes can book a time slot 10 minutes from now
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Same-day booking (6-12 hours)">
    **Setting**: Athletes must book at least 6-12 hours before session

    **When to use**:

    - You check schedule morning and evening
    - Want some advance notice but allow same-day
    - Balancing flexibility with planning

    **Example**:

    - 12-hour notice = If athlete wants 6pm session, must book by 6am that day
    - Gives you time to see booking and prepare

    **Sweet spot**: 6-hour minimum for flexible same-day bookings
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="24-hour minimum notice">
    **Setting**: Athletes must book at least 24 hours before session

    **When to use**:

    - Standard personal training
    - You want day-ahead planning
    - Need time to review athlete info and prepare
    - Most common setting

    **Example**: Athlete wants Tuesday 5pm session, must book by Monday 5pm

    **Pros**:

    - Clear day-ahead schedule visibility
    - Time to prepare and review athlete goals
    - Professional standard

    **Cons**:

    - Can't accommodate true last-minute requests
    - May lose some spontaneous bookings

    <Tip>
      **Recommended**: 24-hour minimum is the industry standard for personal training and most coaching services.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="48-72 hour minimum notice">
    **Setting**: Athletes must book 2-3 days in advance

    **When to use**:

    - High-demand services with waitlists
    - Sessions requiring special prep or materials
    - When you need planning time
    - Specialty assessment or evaluation sessions

    **Example**: "Competition Readiness Assessment" - 72-hour minimum notice allows you to review athlete history and prepare custom evaluation

    **Pros**: Maximum planning time, serious athlete commitment **Cons**: Very restrictive, may limit bookings
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Maximum future booking window

**Purpose**: Prevent athletes from booking too far in advance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why limit future bookings?">
    **Problems with unlimited future booking**:

    1. Athlete books 3 months out, forgets, cancels last-minute
    2. Your availability changes but slots are locked
    3. Can't adjust pricing or offerings
    4. Hard to forecast actual attendance

    **Benefits of limiting future bookings**:

    1. More accurate short-term schedule
    2. Flexibility to adjust availability
    3. Reduces forgotten bookings
    4. Athletes book closer to session = higher commitment

    **Business insight**: Bookings made 30 days out have 2x cancellation rate vs bookings made 7 days out
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="30-day booking window (Recommended)">
    **Setting**: Athletes can book up to 30 days in advance

    **When to use**: Most coaching businesses (default setting)

    **Pros**:

    - Enough advance booking for planners
    - Not so far that athletes forget
    - Allows monthly planning
    - Balance of flexibility and commitment

    **Example**:

    - Today: September 30
    - Athletes can book any session through October 30
    - October 31 sessions won't appear until October 1

    **Recommended for**: Private training, group classes, standard coaching services
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="60-90 day booking window">
    **Setting**: Athletes can book 2-3 months in advance

    **When to use**:

    - Seasonal programming (summer camps)
    - Long-term committed athletes
    - Subscription-based programs
    - When you have stable long-term schedule

    **Pros**: Long-term planning for dedicated athletes **Cons**: Higher cancellation rates, less schedule flexibility

    **Example**: "12-Week Transformation Program" - Allow 90-day booking for athletes to secure entire program schedule
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rolling weekly window">
    **Setting**: Athletes can only book the current week + next week

    **When to use**:

    - High-variability schedule
    - Short-term commitments
    - Testing new services
    - Prefer last-minute booking optimization

    **Pros**: Maximum flexibility for you, recent bookings = lower cancellations **Cons**: Frustrates planners, may lose organized athletes

    **Example**: On Monday, athletes can book through next Sunday (up to 13 days out)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unlimited future booking">
    **Setting**: Athletes can book as far out as you have availability

    **When to use**:

    - Rare scenarios only
    - Specialty one-time events
    - When you have 100% stable schedule
    - VIP athletes with priority access

    **Pros**: Ultimate athlete flexibility **Cons**: Reduces your flexibility, high forget-rate

    <Warning>
      **Not recommended**: Unlimited booking creates more problems than it solves for most coaching businesses.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Scheduling windows decision guide

**For most coaches**:

- Minimum notice: 24 hours
- Maximum future: 30 days
- Result: Athletes must book 24+ hours ahead, can book up to 30 days out

**Adjust based on your reality**:

| Your Situation             | Min Notice | Max Future |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Very flexible schedule     | 6 hours    | 14 days    |
| Standard personal training | 24 hours   | 30 days    |
| High-demand specialist     | 48 hours   | 30 days    |
| Seasonal programming       | 24 hours   | 90 days    |
| Events/workshops           | 7 days     | 90 days    |

## Setting 6: Multiple booking permissions

Allow or prevent athletes from booking multiple future sessions at once.

### What it does

**Multiple booking permission** controls whether athletes can:

- ✅ Book several sessions in one action (Book Mon, Wed, Fri all at once)
- ❌ Only book one session at a time (Must book Mon, then separately book Wed, then separately book Fri)

### Decision framework

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Allow Multiple Bookings (Recommended)">
    **Setting**: Athletes CAN book multiple future sessions at once

    **When to use**: Most situations (default)

    **Pros**:

    - Better athlete experience (book whole week in one go)
    - Encourages regular training schedules
    - Saves athlete time
    - Reduces booking friction
    - Athletes can plan ahead

    **Cons**:

    - Athlete might over-book then cancel
    - Could monopolize schedule if no weekly limits

    **Example use case**:

    - Athlete wants regular Monday/Wednesday/Friday training
    - Books all 3 sessions at once
    - Shows up consistently

    **Mitigation**: Combine with weekly booking limits to prevent over-booking

    - Allow multiple bookings: YES
    - Max per week: 3 bookings
    - Result: Athlete can book 3 sessions at once, but not 5

    <Tip>
      **Best practice**: Allow multiple bookings WITH weekly limits = athlete convenience + business protection
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Restrict to Single Bookings">
    **Setting**: Athletes can ONLY book one session at a time

    **When to use**: Rare situations only

    **Scenarios**:

    1. **Trial/intro sessions**: Want athlete to complete first session before booking more
    2. **Assessment-required**: Must evaluate athlete before allowing regular booking
    3. **High-demand schedule**: Force athletes to commit session-by-session

    **Pros**:

    - Ensures athlete commitment per session
    - Can assess fit before ongoing relationship
    - Reduces bulk cancellations

    **Cons**:

    - Poor athlete experience (tedious to book each session separately)
    - Discourages regular training schedules
    - More friction = fewer bookings

    **Example**:

    - "First Assessment Session" scheduler = Single booking only
    - After assessment, unlock "Regular Training" scheduler = Multiple bookings allowed

    <Warning>
      **UX impact**: Single-booking restriction frustrates athletes. Only use when absolutely necessary for business reasons.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Implementation strategy

**Recommended configuration for most coaches**:

```
✅ Allow multiple bookings: YES
✅ Max bookings per week: 2-3 sessions
✅ Max bookings per day: 1 session
```

**Result**:

- Athlete CAN book multiple sessions at once (convenient)
- But CANNOT exceed 3 per week (fair access)
- And CANNOT book 2 sessions same day (prevents monopolization)

**Example scenario**:

- Monday: Athlete attempts to book Mon, Wed, Fri, and next Monday (4 sessions)
- System allows: Mon, Wed, Fri (within 3/week limit)
- System blocks: Next Monday (would exceed 3/week in current rolling week)
- Athlete books those 3, then books next Monday the following week

## Putting it all together: Complete configuration examples

Real-world scheduler configurations from different coaching businesses:

### Example 1: Coach (Jake) - Private Training

**Business context**:

- Solo trainer with 25 slots per week
- 15 active athletes
- Building clientele, needs flexibility but protection

**Scheduler settings**:

```
Name: "60-Minute Private Training"
Capacity: 1 athlete
Booking limits:
  - Max per day: 1 session
  - Max per week: 2 sessions
Cancellation policy: 24-hour notice, refund credits
Buffer time:
  - Before: 5 minutes
  - After: 10 minutes
Scheduling windows:
  - Minimum notice: 24 hours
  - Maximum future: 30 days
Multiple bookings: Yes (allowed)
```

**Why this works**:

- 1 athlete per slot = true private training
- 2 sessions/week = fair distribution across 15 athletes
- 24-hour policy = business protection with athlete flexibility
- 15-min buffer = sustainable schedule, prevent burnout
- 30-day window = planning for committed athletes, not too far to forget
- Multiple bookings allowed = athlete convenience with weekly limit protection

**Expected outcomes**:

- 15 athletes × 2 sessions = 30 potential bookings (you have 25 slots, slight over-capacity allows for cancellations)
- Fair access for all athletes
- Sustainable coaching schedule with built-in breaks

## Common configuration mistakes and fixes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mistake 1: Settings don't match service reality">
    **Problem**: "Small Group Training" with 15-athlete capacity and no booking limits

    **Why it's wrong**:

    - 15 athletes isn't "small group"
    - No limits means same 15 book every session
    - Others can never access the class

    **Fix**:

    ```
    Option A: Change capacity to match promise
    - Rename to "Large Group Training"
    - Keep 15-athlete capacity
    - Add 2 sessions/week limit for fair access
    
    Option B: Change name to match capacity
    - Capacity: 6 athletes (truly small)
    - Name: "Small Group Training"
    - Keep 3 sessions/week limit
    ```

    **Lesson**: Settings must align with service promise
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mistake 2: Too lenient = revenue loss">
    **Problem**:

    - Anytime cancellation
    - No booking notice
    - Unlimited bookings

    **Result**:

    - 40% cancellation rate
    - Last-minute cancellations can't be filled
    - Revenue significantly impacted

    **Fix**:

    ```
    Implement minimum standards:
    - 24-hour cancellation policy (refund credits within window)
    - 24-hour minimum booking notice
    - 2-3 sessions per week limit
    
    Expected result:
    - Cancellation rate drops to 15-20%
    - More rebook opportunities
    - Improved revenue stability
    ```

    **Lesson**: Protecting your business isn't mean, it's professional
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mistake 3: Too strict = athlete frustration">
    **Problem**:

    - No cancellations allowed
    - 72-hour booking notice
    - Single booking only

    **Result**:

    - Athletes afraid to book (too restrictive)
    - Bookings drop 50%
    - Negative reviews about inflexibility

    **Fix**:

    ```
    Find middle ground:
    - 24-48 hour cancellation with credit refund
    - 24-hour booking notice
    - Allow multiple bookings with weekly limits
    
    Expected result:
    - Booking volume recovers
    - Athlete satisfaction improves
    - Still have business protection
    ```

    **Lesson**: Balance protection with athlete-friendly policies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mistake 4: No buffer time strategy">
    **Problem**:

    - Zero buffer between sessions
    - Constantly running late
    - Exhausted and burned out

    **Impact**:

    - Poor athlete experience (you're always rushed)
    - Documentation suffers (no time for notes)
    - Health declines from no breaks

    **Fix**:

    ```
    Implement staged approach:
    Week 1: Add 5-min buffer after sessions
    Week 2: Increase to 10-min buffer
    Week 3: Add 5-min before buffer if needed
    
    Monitor: How do you feel? Less rushed?
    Adjust: Find YOUR optimal buffer time
    ```

    **Lesson**: Your well-being enables athlete results - protect it
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mistake 5: One-size-fits-all configuration">
    **Problem**: Same settings for private training, group classes, and events

    **Why it fails**:

    - Private training needs 1 capacity, group classes need 12
    - Events need 72-hour notice, regular training needs 24-hour
    - Different services have different requirements

    **Fix**:

    ```
    Create service-specific schedulers:
    
    "Private Training"
    - 1 capacity, 24-hour policy, 10-min buffer
    
    "Group Class"
    - 12 capacity, 24-hour policy, 20-min buffer
    
    "Workshop Event"
    - 30 capacity, 7-day notice required, 60-min buffer
    ```

    **Lesson**: Different services need different configurations

## Troubleshooting scheduler settings

### Athletes can't book even though slots are available

**Possible causes**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check booking limits">
    Has athlete already reached max bookings for day or week?

    **How to check**:

    1. Go to athlete's profile
    2. View their booking history
    3. Count bookings in current week

    **Fix**: If limit is too restrictive, increase weekly limit or explain policy to athlete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check minimum notice">
    Is athlete trying to book within minimum notice window?

    **Example**:

    - Settings: 24-hour minimum notice
    - Athlete tries to book session 12 hours from now
    - System blocks booking

    **Fix**: Reduce minimum notice OR manually book athlete for this one time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check maximum future window">
    Is athlete trying to book beyond future booking window?

    **Example**:

    - Settings: 30-day maximum
    - Athlete tries to book 45 days out
    - Sessions don't appear

    **Fix**: Increase future window OR ask athlete to book closer to date
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check capacity">
    Is session already at capacity?

    **How to check**: View the specific time slot - is it full?

    **Fix**: If truly full, offer different time OR increase capacity if appropriate
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Cancellation policy isn't working as expected

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Athletes canceling within window but credits not refunded">
    **Check**:

    1. Settings → Cancellation policy
    2. Verify "Refund credits on cancellation" is enabled
    3. Check if cancellation was within allowed window

    **Possible issue**: Policy says 24-hour notice but athlete canceled 20 hours before

    **Fix**: Manually refund credit this time, explain policy clearly for future
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athletes canceling late but still getting refunds">
    **Check**:

    - Is cancellation policy set to "Anytime" instead of "24-hour notice"?
    - System might be configured differently than you think

    **Fix**:

    1. Edit scheduler settings
    2. Change from "Anytime cancellation" to "24-hour notice required"
    3. Update athlete communications about policy change
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Buffer time not preventing bookings

**Problem**: Athletes booking back-to-back even though you set buffer time

**Troubleshooting**:

1. **Check buffer settings**: Go to scheduler → Settings → Buffer time
   - Is buffer actually configured? (Should see "Before: X min, After: X min")
   - Try test booking to verify buffer blocks adjacent slots
2. **Multiple schedulers issue**:
   - Scheduler A has 10-min buffer
   - Scheduler B has no buffer
   - Athletes can book Scheduler A at 3:00 PM and Scheduler B at 4:00 PM (appears back-to-back on your calendar)
   - **Fix**: Add consistent buffer to ALL schedulers
3. **Manual bookings bypass buffer**:
   - If YOU manually book athletes, system may allow override of buffer
   - **Fix**: Manually respect buffer when booking athletes yourself
