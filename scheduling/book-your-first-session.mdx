## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional bookable session that athletes can book on their own. No technical knowledge required—just follow these steps and you'll be accepting bookings in about 10 minutes.

<Check>
  **Success criteria**: Athletes can visit your booking page, see available times, and book your session—all without you lifting a finger.
</Check>

<Info>
  **New to scheduling?** If you haven't read the overview yet, that's okay. This guide walks you through everything step-by-step. You can learn the "why" later—right now, let's get you operational.
</Info>

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- CoachIQ account created and logged in
- At least one athlete added to your system (optional, but helpful for testing)
- 10 minutes of uninterrupted time

<Tip>
  **First-timer recommendation**: Create a **free** session for your first setup. You can always add payment or credits later. This lets you focus on the mechanics without worrying about payment configuration.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Navigate to the Scheduler Builder

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Schedule section">
    From your CoachIQ dashboard, click **Schedule** in the main navigation menu on the left side.

    <Frame>
      ![Schedule menu item in CoachIQ dashboard navigation](/images/navigate-to-schedule.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Schedulers">
    Click on **Schedulers** from the Schedule submenu. This is where you'll create and manage all your bookable session types.

    <Frame>
      ![Schedulers option in Schedule menu](/images/schedulers-submenu.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start creating a new scheduler">
    Click the **Create** button in the top-right corner, then select **Create Scheduler** from the dropdown options.

    <Frame>
      ![Create button and scheduler option](/images/create-scheduler-button.png)
    </Frame>
    This opens the Scheduler Builder—your control panel for configuring this session type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure basic session details

Now you'll set up the fundamental information about your session.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your session (what athletes see)">
    In the **Session Name** field, enter a clear, descriptive name for your session.

    **Good examples**:

    - "60-Minute Private Training"
    - "Small Group Hitting Session"
    - "Free Assessment Session"
    - "Technique & Form Check"

    **Avoid**:

    - Generic names like "Session 1" or "Training"
    - Internal codes like "PT-60-A"
    - Overly long descriptions

    <Tip>
      **Naming tip**: Include the duration in the name so athletes know what they're booking: "30-Min Quick Session" is clearer than just "Quick Session"
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a description (optional but recommended)">
    Click **Add Description** to explain what athletes can expect in this session.

    **What to include**:

    - What you'll work on during the session
    - What athletes should bring or wear
    - Any prerequisites or skill level requirements
    - What makes this session valuable

    **Example description**:

    > "Work one-on-one with Coach Mike on batting technique, swing mechanics, and approach at the plate. Perfect for players looking to improve their hitting consistency and power. Bring your bat and batting gloves."

    <Note>
      Athletes see this description when deciding whether to book, so make it compelling and informative.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the session duration">
    Choose how long this session will last:

    - **15 minutes** - Quick check-ins, brief consultations
    - **30 minutes** - Standard training sessions, focused skill work
    - **45 minutes** - Extended training sessions
    - **60 minutes** - Full training sessions (most common)
    - **Custom** - Any duration you need

    For your first session, **60 minutes** is a safe choice—it's the most common duration for private training.

    <Frame>
      ![Duration options in scheduler builder](/images/session-duration-selector.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Set your availability

This is where you tell CoachIQ when you're available to coach this session.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your availability approach">
    You have two options for your first session:

    **Option A: Quick Weekly Pattern** (Recommended for first session)
    Set recurring weekly hours like "Every Monday/Wednesday/Friday 3-7 PM"

    **Option B: Specific Dates**
    Manually select specific dates you're available

    For this guide, we'll use **Option A** (weekly pattern) since it's faster to set up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your available days">
    Check the boxes for the days you're available to coach this session.

    For example, if you coach Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:

    - ✅ Monday
    - ✅ Wednesday
    - ✅ Friday

    <Frame>
      ![Day of week selection in scheduler builder](/images/availability-day-selection.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your available hours">
    For each day you selected, set your start and end times.

    **Example**:

    - Monday: 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM
    - Wednesday: 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM
    - Friday: 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: CoachIQ automatically breaks your availability into bookable slots based on your session duration. If you set 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM with 60-minute sessions, athletes will see slots at 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, and 7:00 PM.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add buffer time (optional but recommended)">
    Buffer time adds a break between back-to-back sessions. This gives you time to:

    - Reset your training area
    - Use the restroom
    - Review notes for the next athlete
    - Handle sessions that run slightly over

    **Recommended buffer**: 10-15 minutes

    Athletes don't see buffer time—they just see properly spaced available slots.

    <Frame>
      ![Buffer time configuration](/images/buffer-time-setting.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Configure payment settings

<Info>
  **First session recommendation**: Start with a **FREE** session to learn the system. You can create paid sessions after you're comfortable with the basics.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Free Session (Recommended First)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select 'Free' payment option">
        In the Payment section, select **Free**.

        No additional configuration needed—athletes can book without payment or credits.
      </Step>
      <Step title="When to use free sessions">
        Perfect for:

        - Your very first session while learning
        - Free trial sessions for new athletes
        - Makeup sessions after cancellations
        - Team practices or meetings
        - Assessment sessions before selling packages
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Direct Payment">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select 'Paywall' payment option">
        In the Payment section, select **Paywall**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect to a product">
        Click **Select Product** and choose which one-time payment product athletes must purchase to book.

        If you don't have a product yet, click **Create Product** to set one up quickly with your session price.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set your price">
        Enter the price athletes pay to book this session (e.g., \$75).
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    **When to use**: Drop-in sessions, one-time bookings, new clients who haven't purchased packages yet.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Credit-Based">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable credit payment">
        In the Payment section, toggle **Enable Credit Payment** to ON.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set credit price">
        Enter how many credits this session costs (e.g., 1 credit, 2 credits, etc.).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Athletes must have credits first">
        For credit-based sessions, athletes need credits in their account before they can book. Credits come from:

        - Credit packages you sell them
        - Subscriptions that issue recurring credits
        - Manual credit grants from you
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    **When to use**: Ongoing training relationships, monthly memberships, session packages, subscription-based coaching.

    <Note>
      **Coming back later**: If you want to set up credits properly, see our [Credit System Guide](/scheduling/credit-system-explained) after completing this first session setup.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Set capacity and booking rules

These settings control how many athletes can book and when they can book.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set maximum capacity">
    **Max Athletes Per Session**: How many athletes can book the same time slot?

    - **1 athlete** = Private 1-on-1 sessions (most common for first session)
    - **2-10 athletes** = Small group training
    - **10+ athletes** = Large group classes or team training

    For your first session, set this to **1** for simple 1-on-1 training.

    <Frame>
      ![Maximum athletes per session setting](/images/capacity-setting.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set booking window (optional)">
    Control how far in advance athletes can book:

    **Minimum notice**: How soon before a session can it be booked?

    - Example: "24 hours" prevents last-minute bookings

    **Maximum future booking**: How far ahead can athletes book?

    - Example: "30 days" means athletes can only book sessions in the next month

    **For your first session**: Leave these empty to allow booking anytime. You can add restrictions later as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review other settings (leave defaults for now)">
    You'll see other options like:

    - Cancellation policies
    - Multiple bookings per athlete
    - Daily/weekly booking limits

    **For your first session**: Leave these at their default settings. You can fine-tune them later once you understand how they work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Save and activate your scheduler

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Save' or 'Create Scheduler'">
    Look for the save button (usually top-right or bottom-right of the screen).

    <Check>
      **Success!** Your scheduler is now created and active. CoachIQ has automatically generated bookable time slots based on your availability.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your scheduler">
    You'll be taken back to the Schedulers page where you should see your newly created session listed.

    <Frame>
      ![Schedulers page showing your new session](/images/scheduler-list-view.png)
    </Frame>
    Notice the information displayed:

    - Session name
    - Duration (60 min)
    - Capacity (1/1 or group size)
    - Credit cost or price
    - Active date range
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Test the athlete booking experience

<Warning>
  **Critical step**: Always test your session BEFORE sharing it with athletes. This catches configuration issues, confusing wording, or availability problems.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your scheduler's booking link">
    From the Schedulers page, click on your newly created scheduler to open its details.

    Look for the **Share** or **Booking Link** button—this is the URL athletes use to book.

    Copy this link.

    <Frame>
      ![Finding the booking link for your scheduler](/images/scheduler-booking-link.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the booking link in a new browser tab">
    Paste the link into a new browser tab (or private/incognito window to see exactly what athletes see).

    You should see:

    - Your session name and description
    - Available time slots
    - Duration clearly displayed
    - Booking button or payment information

    <Frame>
      ![What athletes see when viewing your bookable session](/images/athlete-booking-view.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test book a session (if possible)">
    If you have a test athlete account or can create one:

    1. Click on an available time slot
    2. Go through the booking process
    3. Confirm the booking goes through successfully
    4. Check that you receive a confirmation
    5. Verify the booking appears on your calendar

    If you can't test book, at minimum verify that:

    - Available times are showing correctly
    - Your description is clear and compelling
    - The payment/credit information is accurate
    - Times match your intended availability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your calendar">
    Navigate to **Schedule → Calendar** and verify:

    - Your availability windows appear (if showing empty slots)
    - Test bookings appear on the correct dates/times
    - Session information displays properly

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar showing available sessions](/images/calendar-with-availability.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 8: Share with athletes

Once you've tested and verified everything works, you're ready to start accepting real bookings!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Share the Direct Link">
    **Best for**: Quick sharing, social media, direct messages

    Copy the booking link from your scheduler and share it directly:

    - Text/SMS to athletes: "Book your session here: [link]"
    - Email: Include link in your email signature or newsletters
    - Social media: Post to Instagram, Facebook, or other platforms
    - WhatsApp/messaging apps

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Create a short, memorable custom link using a URL shortener like bit.ly if your booking link is long.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Embed on Your Website">
    **Best for**: Professional presentation, integrated booking experience

    CoachIQ lets you embed schedulers directly on your website.

    1. Go to **Website & App → Website Builder**
    2. Add a "Scheduling" section to your page
    3. Select which schedulers to display
    4. Publish your website

    Athletes can now book without leaving your site.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Through Your CoachIQ App">
    **Best for**: Athletes who use your mobile app

    If athletes use your CoachIQ-powered mobile app, your schedulers automatically appear in their **Sessions** or **Book** section.

    No additional setup needed—athletes already have access.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Booking (Coach Initiated)">
    **Best for**: VIP clients, standing appointments, special situations

    You can book athletes directly without them self-booking:

    1. Go to **Schedule → Calendar**
    2. Click **Book Session** button
    3. Select the athlete, your scheduler, and time
    4. Confirm the booking

    The athlete receives a confirmation notification automatically.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Success checklist

Before you move on, confirm you've completed these steps:

- Created your first scheduler with a clear name
- Set your availability (days and times)
- Configured payment settings (free, paid, or credits)
- Set capacity to match your training style (1-on-1 or group)
- Saved and activated the scheduler
- Tested the booking link as if you were an athlete
- Verified bookings appear correctly on your calendar
- Shared the booking link or embedded on your website

<Check>
  **Congratulations!** You now have a fully functional booking system. Athletes can book sessions 24/7 without any back-and-forth coordination from you.
</Check>

## Common issues and quick fixes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see any available times when I test the booking link">
    **Most common causes**:

    1. You haven't set availability yet—go back and add your available days/times
    2. Your availability is in the past—check that your end date is in the future
    3. You set minimum notice too high—athletes can't book within that notice period
    4. You have blackout days blocking all your availability

    **Quick fix**: Edit your scheduler, verify availability is set correctly, and save again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athletes see times I don't want to be available">
    **Cause**: Your availability window is too broad, or you haven't set blackout days for specific dates you're unavailable.

    **Quick fix**:

    - Edit your scheduler and narrow your availability hours
    - Add blackout days for dates you're unavailable (vacation, holidays, etc.)
    - Consider adding buffer time so sessions aren't too close together
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The booking link isn't working or shows an error">
    **Most common causes**:

    1. Scheduler isn't saved/active yet—verify it appears in your Schedulers list
    2. You're using an old or incorrect link—get a fresh link from the scheduler
    3. Date range has expired—check your scheduler's start/end dates

    **Quick fix**: Re-save your scheduler and copy a fresh booking link.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want to change the session after athletes have booked">
    **Good news**: You can edit schedulers at any time. However:

    - Existing bookings are NOT automatically updated
    - Future available slots will use the new settings
    - If you need to change existing bookings, you'll need to manually reschedule them

    **Quick fix**: Edit the scheduler for future bookings, manually adjust existing bookings from your calendar if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete this test session and start over?">
    **Yes**, but understand what happens:

    - Deleting a scheduler removes all future available slots
    - Existing bookings remain on your calendar but become "orphaned"
    - Better approach: Just edit the existing scheduler rather than deleting and recreating

    **Quick fix**: Click the three-dot menu on your scheduler and select **Edit** rather than deleting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro tips for your first session

<Tip>
  **Start conservative with availability**: It's easier to add more available times later than to cancel bookings when you've opened up too much availability.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use descriptive names**: "60-Min Hitting Lesson with Video Analysis" is more compelling than "Hitting Session"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Add a compelling description**: Athletes are more likely to book when they understand exactly what they'll get from the session.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test on mobile**: Many athletes will book from their phones—make sure your booking link works well on mobile devices.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor your first bookings closely**: After your first few bookings, check that everything works smoothly (confirmations sent, calendar updated, etc.) before scaling up.
</Tip>
