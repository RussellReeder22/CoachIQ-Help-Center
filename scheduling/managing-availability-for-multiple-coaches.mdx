## When you need multi-coach availability

If you answered "yes" to any of these, this guide is for you:

- ✅ You employ or work with other coaches/trainers
- ✅ Athletes can book sessions with different coaches
- ✅ You run a facility with multiple trainers on staff
- ✅ You co-coach with partners or assistants
- ✅ You need to prevent double-booking across your team

Multi-coach scheduling requires strategic thinking about availability, assignments, and conflict prevention.

</Info>

## The multi-coach scheduling challenge

With multiple coaches, you face coordination challenges that solo coaches don't:

**Scheduling conflicts**:

- Coach A and Coach B both available Monday 3-5 PM
- Athlete books with Coach A at 3:00 PM
- Different athlete tries to book Coach A at 3:00 PM → Should be blocked
- But Coach B at 3:00 PM should still be available

**Facility capacity**:

- Gym has 3 training areas
- 5 coaches on staff
- Maximum 3 coaches can work simultaneously (space limitation)
- Need to track facility capacity, not just individual coach availability

**Team coordination**:

- Some coaches work specific days only
- Some coaches share availability (either can take the session)
- Some sessions require specific coaches
- Substitution rules when primary coach is unavailable

<Check>
  **Goal**: Athletes can book with the right coach at the right time, while preventing conflicts and respecting both coach availability and facility capacity.

## Multi-coach setup approaches

Choose the approach that matches your business model:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approach 1: Coach-Specific Schedulers">
    **How it works**: Each coach has their own separate schedulers

    **Example**:

    - "Private Training with Coach Mike"
    - "Private Training with Coach Sarah"
    - "Private Training with Coach David"

    **Best for**:

    - Coaches with distinct specialties or styles
    - Athletes who prefer specific coaches
    - Different pricing per coach (experience levels)
    - Clear separation of bookings

    **Pros**:

    - Simple to set up and understand
    - Clear attribution (each booking tied to specific coach)
    - Easy individual coach management
    - Natural pricing differentiation

    **Cons**:

    - Creates many schedulers (can clutter athlete booking view)
    - Less flexibility for substitution
    - Requires athletes to choose coach upfront

    <Frame>
      ![Multiple schedulers each assigned to specific coach](/images/coach-specific-schedulers.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Approach 2: Shared Schedulers with Multi-Coach Assignment">
    **How it works**: One scheduler, multiple coaches assigned to it

    **Example**:

    - "Private Training Session" (any available coach)
      - Assigned coaches: Mike, Sarah, David

    **Best for**:

    - Athletes don't care which coach
    - Interchangeable coaching (standardized approach)
    - Maximizing availability across team
    - Facility-style booking

    **Pros**:

    - Cleaner athlete booking experience (fewer scheduler choices)
    - Maximum flexibility for scheduling
    - Easy substitution
    - Better utilization of coach time

    **Cons**:

    - Less coach differentiation
    - May require manual assignment after booking
    - Harder to track individual coach metrics
    - Same pricing for all coaches

    <Frame>
      ![Single scheduler with multiple coach assignments](/images/shared-scheduler-multiple-coaches.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Approach 3: Hybrid (Coach-Specific + Shared)">
    **How it works**: Some schedulers are coach-specific, others are shared

    **Example**:

    - "Elite Training with Coach Mike" (Mike only, premium pricing)
    - "Elite Training with Coach Sarah" (Sarah only, premium pricing)
    - "Standard Training Session" (Any available coach)
    - "Youth Development Session" (Coach David or Coach Emma)

    **Best for**:

    - Tiered coaching levels (lead coaches vs assistants)
    - Specialty services requiring specific coaches
    - Flexibility where possible, specificity where needed
    - Growing facilities transitioning approaches

    **Pros**:

    - Best of both worlds
    - Pricing flexibility
    - Coach specialization respected
    - Availability maximized

    **Cons**:

    - More complex to set up
    - Requires careful planning
    - Athletes need to understand the system
    - More schedulers to manage

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Most successful multi-coach operations use this hybrid approach. Premium services with specific coaches, standard services with any available coach.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting up coach-specific availability

Each coach needs their own availability template based on when they work.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan your coach availability structure">
    Before configuring, map out each coach's schedule:

    **Example planning doc**:

    - **Coach Mike**: Monday/Wednesday/Friday 3-8 PM
    - **Coach Sarah**: Tuesday/Thursday 4-9 PM, Saturday 9 AM-2 PM
    - **Coach David**: Monday-Friday 5-9 PM (evening specialist)
    - **Coach Emma**: Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday 10 AM-3 PM (youth specialist)

    <Frame>
      ![Spreadsheet of coach availability](/images/coach-availability-planning-doc.png)
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      **Overlap is okay**: Multiple coaches can have overlapping availability. This is actually beneficial—it provides flexibility and prevents single points of failure.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create first coach's scheduler with availability">
    For Coach Mike:

    1. Create scheduler: "Private Training with Coach Mike"
    2. Set availability: M/W/F 3-8 PM
    3. Set pricing, duration, capacity as normal
    4. In scheduler settings, assign/tag this scheduler to Coach Mike
    5. Save scheduler

    <Frame>
      ![Creating scheduler for specific coach](/images/create-coach-mike-scheduler.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **Naming convention**: Use consistent naming: "[Session Type] with Coach [Name]" makes it easy for athletes to understand and for you to manage.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create schedulers for remaining coaches">
    Repeat for each coach:

    **Coach Sarah's scheduler**:

    - Name: "Private Training with Coach Sarah"
    - Availability: T/Th 4-9 PM, Sat 9 AM-2 PM
    - Assign to Coach Sarah

    **Coach David's scheduler**:

    - Name: "Evening Sessions with Coach David"
    - Availability: M-F 5-9 PM
    - Assign to Coach David

    **Coach Emma's scheduler**:

    - Name: "Youth Training with Coach Emma"
    - Availability: T/Th/Sat 10 AM-3 PM
    - Assign to Coach Emma

    <Check>
      **Result**: Each coach now has their own scheduler with appropriate availability. Athletes can choose which coach to book with.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test booking experience">
    View the athlete-facing booking page:

    - ✅ All coaches' schedulers appear
    - ✅ Each shows appropriate available times
    - ✅ Coach names are clear
    - ✅ Pricing is displayed
    - ✅ Athletes can distinguish between coaches

    <Frame>
      ![Athlete booking view showing multiple coach options](/images/athlete-view-multiple-coaches.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify calendar separation">
    Check your calendar:

    - Use **Filter by Coach** to see each coach's bookings separately
    - Verify bookings are correctly attributed to right coach
    - Confirm no double-booking within same coach
    - Test that different coaches CAN have overlapping bookings

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar filtered to show specific coach's bookings](/images/calendar-filter-by-coach.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up shared schedulers (any available coach)

For schedulers where any coach can take the session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the shared scheduler">
    Create one scheduler for the session type:

    - Name: "Standard Private Training" (no coach name)
    - Set availability combining all coaches' hours (or standard facility hours)
    - Set pricing and settings as normal

    <Frame>
      ![Creating scheduler without specific coach assignment](/images/create-shared-scheduler.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign multiple coaches to the scheduler">
    In the scheduler settings, look for:

    - **Assigned Coaches**
    - **Connected Coaches**
    - **Available Coaches**
    - Or similar option

    Select all coaches who can deliver this session:

    - ☑️ Coach Mike
    - ☑️ Coach Sarah
    - ☑️ Coach David
    - ☑️ Coach Emma

    <Frame>
      ![Assigning multiple coaches to shared scheduler](/images/assign-multiple-coaches.png)
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      **Important**: How multi-coach assignment works varies by system. Some automatically prevent double-booking, others require manual coach assignment after booking.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure conflict prevention">
    If your system supports it, set rules for:

    - **Prevent coach double-booking**: System blocks coach if already booked
    - **Allow overbooking**: Multiple sessions can be assigned to same coach at same time (useful for group sessions)
    - **Manual assignment required**: Admin assigns coach after athlete books

    <Tip>
      **Recommended setting**: "Prevent coach double-booking" ensures coaches aren't scheduled for two places simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the booking and assignment flow">
    As a test athlete:

    1. Book a session from the shared scheduler
    2. Check if coach is auto-assigned or requires manual assignment
    3. Book a second session at the same time
    4. Verify first coach is blocked but others remain available

    <Check>
      **Success**: System properly manages which coaches are available for each time slot based on existing bookings.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preventing double-booking across coaches

Double-booking prevention is critical in multi-coach environments.

### What needs to be prevented

**Individual coach double-booking** ✅

- Coach Mike can't be booked for two sessions at 3:00 PM simultaneously
- System must track each coach's bookings independently

**Facility capacity limits** ✅

- If gym only has 3 training areas, max 3 concurrent sessions
- Even if 5 coaches are available, facility capacity limits total bookings

**Equipment conflicts** ⚠️

- If you have 2 squat racks, max 2 squat-focused sessions simultaneously
- This is harder to enforce in most systems

### CoachIQ's conflict prevention

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coach-Specific Schedulers: Natural Prevention">
    When each coach has their own scheduler, double-booking prevention happens automatically:

    **How it works**:

    - Athlete books "Private Training with Coach Mike" at 3:00 PM
    - That 3:00 PM slot on Coach Mike's scheduler becomes unavailable
    - Other athletes can't book Coach Mike at 3:00 PM
    - Coach Sarah's 3:00 PM slot remains available (different scheduler)

    **No additional configuration needed** ✅
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Shared Schedulers: Requires Configuration">
    When multiple coaches share one scheduler, you need explicit conflict settings:

    **Option 1: Auto-assign first available coach**

    - System assigns whichever coach is available
    - Once assigned, that coach becomes unavailable for that time
    - Remaining coaches still available

    **Option 2: Manual coach assignment after booking**

    - Athlete books the session
    - Admin later assigns which coach will take it
    - Risk: Accidentally assigning coach who's already booked

    **Option 3: Allow overlapping bookings**

    - System permits multiple sessions with same coach simultaneously
    - Used for group sessions or team practice

    <Warning>
      **Critical**: Understand which option your system uses. If manual assignment is required, you MUST monitor new bookings and assign coaches to prevent accidental double-booking.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Facility Capacity Limits">
    Some advanced systems allow setting facility-wide capacity limits:

    **Example setup**:

    - Gym has 3 training areas
    - Set capacity: Maximum 3 concurrent sessions
    - Once 3 sessions are booked for 3:00 PM (across all coaches), no more 3:00 PM slots available

    **Most systems DON'T have this feature** ⚠️

    **Workaround**: Use scheduler capacity settings

    - Instead of unlimited capacity per coach
    - Set max capacity = facility capacity
    - Limits total bookings regardless of coach
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing coach schedules and time off

With multiple coaches, blackout days and schedule changes become more complex.

### Individual coach time off

<Steps>
  <Step title="Coach notifies you of time off">
    Coach Sarah is taking vacation July 10-20.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add blackout days to that coach's schedulers">
    For all schedulers assigned to Coach Sarah:

    1. Edit each scheduler
    2. Add blackout days: July 10-20
    3. Save

    <Frame>
      ![Adding blackout days to one coach's scheduler](/images/coach-specific-blackout.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cancel existing bookings with that coach">
    Check calendar for Coach Sarah's bookings during July 10-20:

    1. Cancel each booking
    2. Offer to reschedule with Coach Sarah after vacation
    3. OR offer to transfer to different coach if urgent

    <Tip>
      **Communication tip**: "Coach Sarah will be on vacation July 10-20. Your session can be rescheduled with her after July 21, or we can arrange a session with Coach Mike or Coach David during that time. Your preference?"
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify other coaches remain available">
    Check that:

    - ✅ Other coaches' schedulers still show availability July 10-20
    - ✅ Only Coach Sarah's availability is blocked
    - ✅ Athletes can still book with other coaches

    <Check>
      **Result**: One coach's time off doesn't shut down entire operation. Other coaches continue serving athletes.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Facility closure (all coaches affected)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add blackout days to ALL schedulers">
    If gym is closed for maintenance July 15-17:

    1. Go through each coach's scheduler
    2. Add blackout days July 15-17 to all
    3. Save all schedulers

    <Note>
      **Tedious alert**: If you have many schedulers, this is time-consuming. See Schedulers Management Dashboard for bulk management tools.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cancel all bookings during closure">
    Review calendar and cancel all bookings (regardless of coach) during July 15-17.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communicate facility closure">
    Send announcement to all athletes:

    - Facility closed July 15-17 for maintenance
    - All sessions canceled, credits refunded
    - Booking reopens July 18

    <Frame>
      ![Announcement about facility closure](/images/facility-closure-announcement.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing schedulers for multi-coach operations

As you add coaches and session types, organization becomes critical.

### Naming conventions that scale

**Good naming patterns**:

**By Coach + Session Type**:

- "Private Training - Coach Mike"
- "Private Training - Coach Sarah"
- "Group Class - Coach David"
- "Youth Training - Coach Emma"

**By Service Level + Coach**:

- "Premium Training - Coach Mike" (\$100)
- "Standard Training - Any Coach" (\$75)
- "Intro Session - Any Coach" (\$50)

**By Specialty + Coach**:

- "Strength Training - Coach Mike"
- "Speed Development - Coach Sarah"
- "Youth Skills - Coach Emma"
- "Team Training - Coach David"

**Bad naming patterns** ❌:

- "Session 1", "Session 2", "Session 3"
- Just coach names without context
- Inconsistent formats mixing patterns

### Using program groupings

Group schedulers into logical categories for athletes:

**Example groupings**:

**"Private Training" group**:

- Private with Coach Mike
- Private with Coach Sarah
- Private with Coach David
- Private with any available coach

**"Group Sessions" group**:

- Small Group Training
- Team Practice
- Weekend Bootcamp

**"Specialized Training" group**:

- Speed & Agility (Coach Sarah)
- Strength & Conditioning (Coach Mike)
- Youth Development (Coach Emma)

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Well-organized program groupings dramatically improve the athlete booking experience when you have 10+ schedulers.
</Tip>

## Calendar management for multiple coaches

Effective calendar use is essential for multi-coach coordination.

### Using calendar filters

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter by individual coach">
    **When to use**: Checking specific coach's schedule, managing their bookings

    **How**:

    1. Go to Schedule → Calendar
    2. Use **Filter by Coach** dropdown
    3. Select individual coach

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar filtered to show only one coach](/images/filter-calendar-by-coach.png)
    </Frame>
    **Result**: See only that coach's bookings, making it easy to spot conflicts or gaps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View all coaches simultaneously">
    **When to use**: Facility-wide overview, capacity planning, conflict detection

    **How**:

    1. Go to Calendar
    2. Select "All Coaches" in filter
    3. Switch to Week or Month view for best overview

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar showing all coaches' bookings](/images/calendar-all-coaches-view.png)
    </Frame>
    **Result**: Color-coded by coach, see entire operation's schedule at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View facility capacity">
    **When to use**: Checking if facility is at capacity for specific times

    **How**:

    1. Calendar view (all coaches)
    2. Look at specific time slot
    3. Count concurrent sessions

    **Example**:

    - Monday 3:00 PM: 3 coaches booked
    - If facility max = 3 areas, you're at capacity
    - Can't book 4th session at 3:00 PM

    <Note>
      **Manual management**: Most systems don't automatically enforce facility capacity limits, so you'll need to monitor this yourself.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Color coding and visual organization

Make calendar management easier with visual systems:

**Color by coach**:

- Coach Mike = Blue
- Coach Sarah = Purple
- Coach David = Green
- Coach Emma = Orange

**Result**: Quickly identify which coach has which booking at a glance.

**Color by session type** (alternative):

- Private = Blue
- Group = Green
- Youth = Yellow
- Team = Red

**Result**: Quickly see distribution of session types.

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: If your system allows it, use color coding. It transforms a cluttered calendar into an easily scannable management tool.
</Tip>

## Advanced multi-coach scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Lead Coach + Assistant Coach Structure">
    **Your situation**: Some sessions require lead coach (expensive), others can use assistant (less expensive).

    **Solution**:

    - **Premium Schedulers**: "Elite Training - Coach Mike (Lead)" at \$100
    - **Standard Schedulers**: "Training Session - Coach Sarah (Assistant)" at \$65
    - **Group Schedulers**: "Group Class - Any Coach" at \$40 (either can lead)

    **Assignment rules**:

    - Lead coach must handle premium 1-on-1s
    - Assistant can handle standard sessions
    - Either can handle group classes
    - Assistant can shadow lead coach (both assigned to same session)

    <Frame>
      ![Schedulers organized by coach seniority](/images/lead-assistant-structure.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Specialty-Based Assignment">
    **Your situation**: Coaches have different specializations, athletes book based on need.

    **Solution**:

    - "Strength Training" → Coach Mike only
    - "Speed & Agility" → Coach Sarah only
    - "Youth Development" → Coach Emma only
    - "General Training" → Any coach

    **Athlete decision tree**:

    1. What do you need help with?
    2. Select corresponding specialist scheduler
    3. Book available time

    **Benefit**: Right coach for right need, no mismatch risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: Location-Based Multi-Coach Scheduling">
    **Your situation**: Multiple facilities, different coaches at each location.

    **Solution**:

    - **Downtown Gym**: Coach Mike (M/W/F), Coach Sarah (T/Th)
    - **West Side Location**: Coach David (M-F), Coach Emma (Sat)

    **Scheduler structure**:

    - "Downtown Private Training"
      - Availability: Combines Mike's M/W/F + Sarah's T/Th
      - Connected coaches: Mike, Sarah
    - "West Side Private Training"
      - Availability: David's M-F + Emma's Sat
      - Connected coaches: David, Emma

    **Result**: Location-based booking with automatic coach assignment based on availability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 4: Seasonal or Part-Time Coach Management">
    **Your situation**: Some coaches work year-round, others are seasonal or part-time.

    **Solution**:

    - **Year-round coaches**: Always active schedulers
    - **Seasonal coaches**: Schedulers with date range limits
      - "Summer Training - Coach Alex" (June 1 - August 31 only)
      - Automatically becomes unavailable September 1
    - **Part-time coaches**: Limited availability patterns
      - "Weekend Sessions - Coach Jordan" (Sat/Sun only)

    **Management**:

    - Activate seasonal schedulers when coach starts
    - Deactivate when season ends
    - No need to delete schedulers, just toggle availability

    <Tip>
      **College athlete coaches**: Perfect for this model. Active during summer/winter breaks, inactive during academic year.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting multi-coach issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coach is double-booked at the same time">
    **Possible causes**:

    1. Manual assignment error (if using shared schedulers)
    2. Coach assigned to multiple schedulers with overlapping availability
    3. System conflict prevention not working

    **How to fix**:

    - Cancel one of the bookings
    - Reassign to different coach or time
    - Review scheduler settings to enable conflict prevention
    - If using coach-specific schedulers, verify availability windows don't overlap inappropriately

    <Warning>
      **Prevention**: If using manual coach assignment, create a workflow where one person assigns coaches and checks for conflicts before confirming.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong coach assigned to booking">
    **Issue**: Booking went to Coach A but should have gone to Coach B

    **Causes**:

    - Auto-assignment chose wrong coach
    - Manual assignment error
    - Athlete selected wrong scheduler

    **How to fix**:

    1. Check if booking can be reassigned (some systems support this)
    2. If not, cancel existing booking and rebook with correct coach
    3. Communicate with both coaches and athlete about the change
    4. Credit refund if needed

    **Prevention**: Clear scheduler naming and athlete-facing descriptions help athletes choose correct coach initially.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete can't find the coach they want">
    **Issue**: Too many scheduler options, athlete confused

    **Causes**:

    - Poor organization of schedulers
    - No program groupings
    - Unclear naming conventions

    **How to fix**:

    - Implement program groupings (Group by coach or session type)
    - Add clear descriptions to each scheduler
    - Consider adding photos of each coach to schedulers
    - Create a "Choose Your Coach" guide on your website

    <Tip>
      **Simplification opportunity**: If athletes frequently book the wrong coach, consider moving to "any available coach" model for standard sessions.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coach's availability not showing correctly">
    **Issue**: Coach is available but no slots showing

    **Causes**:

    - Blackout days incorrectly added
    - Availability not saved properly
    - Buffer time consuming all availability
    - Scheduler accidentally deactivated

    **How to fix**:

    - Edit coach's scheduler and verify availability settings
    - Remove inappropriate blackout days
    - Check buffer time calculations
    - Verify scheduler is active/published
    - Test booking flow to confirm slots appear

    **Debug method**: Filter calendar to only that coach and verify availability windows show properly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Facility capacity exceeded">
    **Issue**: More sessions booked than facility can handle

    **Causes**:

    - No capacity limits set on schedulers
    - Manual booking bypassed limits
    - Multiple schedulers each allowing bookings without facility-wide tracking

    **How to fix**:

    - Review calendar and identify over-capacity time slots
    - Contact affected athletes to reschedule
    - Implement capacity limits on schedulers if available
    - Create manual monitoring process for future

    **Prevention**: Set max capacity on shared schedulers to match facility limits, or implement manual approval for bookings during high-demand times.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
