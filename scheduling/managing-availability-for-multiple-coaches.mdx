## When you need multi-coach availability

If you answered "yes" to any of these, this guide is for you:

- ✅ You employ or work with other coaches/trainers
- ✅ Athletes can book sessions with different coaches
- ✅ You run a facility with multiple trainers on staff
- ✅ You co-coach with partners or assistants
- ✅ You need to prevent double-booking across your team

Multi-coach scheduling requires strategic thinking about availability, assignments, and conflict prevention.

## The multi-coach scheduling challenge

With multiple coaches, you face coordination challenges that solo coaches don't:

**Scheduling conflicts**:

- Coach A and Coach B both available Monday 3-5 PM
- Athlete books with Coach A at 3:00 PM
- Different athlete tries to book Coach A at 3:00 PM → Should be blocked
- But Coach B at 3:00 PM should still be available

**Facility capacity**:

- Gym has 3 training areas
- 5 coaches on staff
- Maximum 3 coaches can work simultaneously (space limitation)
- Need to track facility capacity, not just individual coach availability

**Team coordination**:

- Some coaches work specific days only
- Some coaches share availability (either can take the session)
- Some sessions require specific coaches
- Substitution rules when primary coach is unavailable

<Check>
  **Goal**: Athletes can book with the right coach at the right time, while preventing conflicts and respecting both coach availability and facility capacity.
</Check>

## Multi-coach setup approaches

Choose the approach that matches your business model:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approach 1: Coach-Specific Schedulers">
    **How it works**: Each coach has their own separate schedulers

    **Example**:

    - "Private Training with Coach Mike"
    - "Private Training with Coach Sarah"
    - "Private Training with Coach David"

    **Best for**:

    - Coaches with distinct specialties or styles
    - Athletes who prefer specific coaches
    - Different pricing per coach (experience levels)
    - Clear separation of bookings

    **Pros**:

    - Simple to set up and understand
    - Clear attribution (each booking tied to specific coach)
    - Easy individual coach management
    - Natural pricing differentiation

    **Cons**:

    - Creates many schedulers (can clutter athlete booking view)
    - Less flexibility for substitution
    - Requires athletes to choose coach upfront

    <Frame>
      ![Multiple schedulers each assigned to specific coach](/multi-coach-schedulers.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Approach 2: Shared Schedulers with Multi-Coach Assignment">
    **How it works**: One scheduler, multiple coaches assigned to it

    **Example**:

    - "Private Training Session" (any available coach)
      - Assigned coaches: Mike, Sarah, David

    **Best for**:

    - Athletes don't care which coach
    - Interchangeable coaching (standardized approach)
    - Maximizing availability across team
    - Facility-style booking

    **Pros**:

    - Cleaner athlete booking experience (fewer scheduler choices)
    - Maximum flexibility for scheduling
    - Easy substitution
    - Better utilization of coach time

    **Cons**:

    - Less coach differentiation
    - May require manual assignment after booking
    - Harder to track individual coach metrics
    - Same pricing for all coaches

    <Frame>
      ![Single scheduler with multiple coach assignments](/multi-connected-coaches.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Approach 3: Hybrid (Coach-Specific + Shared)">
    **How it works**: Some schedulers are coach-specific, others are shared

    **Example**:

    - "Elite Training with Coach Mike" (Mike only, premium pricing)
    - "Elite Training with Coach Sarah" (Sarah only, premium pricing)
    - "Standard Training Session" (Any available coach)
    - "Youth Development Session" (Coach David or Coach Emma)

    **Best for**:

    - Tiered coaching levels (lead coaches vs assistants)
    - Specialty services requiring specific coaches
    - Flexibility where possible, specificity where needed
    - Growing facilities transitioning approaches

    **Pros**:

    - Best of both worlds
    - Pricing flexibility
    - Coach specialization respected
    - Availability maximized

    **Cons**:

    - More complex to set up
    - Requires careful planning
    - Athletes need to understand the system
    - More schedulers to manage

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Most successful multi-coach operations use this hybrid approach. Premium services with specific coaches, standard services with any available coach.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting up coach-specific availability

Each coach needs their own availability template based on when they work.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan your coach availability structure">
    Before configuring, map out each coach's schedule:

    **Example planning doc**:

    - **Coach Mike**: Monday/Wednesday/Friday 3-8 PM
    - **Coach Sarah**: Tuesday/Thursday 4-9 PM, Saturday 9 AM-2 PM
    - **Coach David**: Monday-Friday 5-9 PM (evening specialist)
    - **Coach Emma**: Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday 10 AM-3 PM (youth specialist)

    <Note>
      **Overlap is okay**: Multiple coaches can have overlapping availability. This is actually beneficial—it provides flexibility and prevents single points of failure.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create first coach's scheduler with availability">
    For Coach Mike:

    2. Create availability: M/W/F 3-8 PM
    1. Create scheduler: "Private Training with Coach Mike"
    3. Set pricing, duration, capacity as normal
    4. In scheduler settings, assign/tag this scheduler to Coach Mike
    5. Save scheduler

    <Tip>
      **Naming convention**: Use consistent naming: "[Session Type] with Coach [Name]" makes it easy for athletes to understand and for you to manage.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create schedulers for remaining coaches">
    Repeat for each coach:

    **Coach Sarah's scheduler**:

    - Name: "Private Training with Coach Sarah"
    - Availability: T/Th 4-9 PM, Sat 9 AM-2 PM
    - Assign to Coach Sarah

    **Coach David's scheduler**:

    - Name: "Evening Sessions with Coach David"
    - Availability: M-F 5-9 PM
    - Assign to Coach David

    **Coach Emma's scheduler**:

    - Name: "Youth Training with Coach Emma"
    - Availability: T/Th/Sat 10 AM-3 PM
    - Assign to Coach Emma

    <Check>
      **Result**: Each coach now has their own scheduler with appropriate availability. Athletes can choose which coach to book with.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test booking experience">
    View the athlete-facing booking page:

    - ✅ All coaches' schedulers appear
    - ✅ Each shows appropriate available times
    - ✅ Coach names are clear
    - ✅ Pricing is displayed
    - ✅ Athletes can distinguish between coaches
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify calendar separation">
    Check your calendar:

    - Use **Filter by Coach** to see each coach's bookings separately
    - Verify bookings are correctly attributed to right coach
    - Confirm no double-booking within same coach
    - Test that different coaches CAN have overlapping bookings

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar filtered to show specific coach's bookings](/coach-schedule-cal.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up shared schedulers (any available coach)

For schedulers where any coach can take the session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the shared scheduler">
    Create one scheduler for the session type:

    - Name: "Private Training" (no coach name)
    - Set availability combining all coaches' hours (or standard facility hours)
    - Set pricing and settings as normal

    <Frame>
      
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign multiple coaches to the scheduler">
    In the scheduler settings, look for:

    - **Assigned Coaches**
    - **Connected Coaches**
    - **Available Coaches**
    - Or similar option

    Select all coaches who can deliver this session:

    - ☑️ Coach Mike
    - ☑️ Coach Sarah
    - ☑️ Coach David
    - ☑️ Coach Emma

    <Frame>
      ![Multi Connected Coaches Pn](/multi-connected-coaches.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure conflict prevention">
    Two options:

    - **Prevent coach double-booking**: System blocks coach if already booked
    - **Allow overbooking**: Multiple sessions can be assigned to same coach at same time (useful for group sessions)

    <Tip>
      **Recommended setting**: "Prevent coach double-booking" ensures coaches aren't scheduled for two places simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the booking and assignment flow">
    As a test athlete:

    1. Book a session from the shared scheduler
    2. Check if coach is auto-assigned
    3. Book a second session at the same time
    4. Verify first coach is blocked but others remain available

    <Check>
      **Success**: System properly manages which coaches are available for each time slot based on existing bookings.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preventing double-booking across coaches

Double-booking prevention is critical in multi-coach environments.

### What needs to be prevented

**Individual coach double-booking** ✅

- Coach Mike can't be booked for two sessions at 3:00 PM simultaneously
- System must track each coach's bookings independently

**Facility capacity limits** ✅

- If gym only has 3 training areas, max 3 concurrent sessions
- Even if 5 coaches are available, facility capacity limits total bookings

### CoachIQ's conflict prevention

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coach-Specific Schedulers: Natural Prevention">
    When each coach has their own scheduler, double-booking prevention happens automatically:

    **How it works**:

    - Athlete books "Private Training with Coach Mike" at 3:00 PM
    - That 3:00 PM slot on Coach Mike's scheduler becomes unavailable
    - Other athletes can't book Coach Mike at 3:00 PM
    - Coach Sarah's 3:00 PM slot remains available (different scheduler)

    **No additional configuration needed** ✅
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Shared Schedulers: Requires Configuration">
    When multiple coaches share one scheduler, you need explicit conflict settings:

    **Option 1: Auto-assign first available coach**

    - System assigns whichever coach is available
    - Once assigned, that coach becomes unavailable for that time
    - Remaining coaches still available

    **Option 2: Allow overlapping bookings**

    - System permits multiple sessions with same coach simultaneously
    - Used for group sessions or team practice

    <Warning>
      **Critical**: Understand which option your system uses. If manual assignment is required, you MUST monitor new bookings and assign coaches to prevent accidental double-booking.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Facility Capacity Limits">
    Some advanced systems allow setting facility-wide capacity limits:

    **Example setup**:

    - Gym has 3 training areas
    - Set capacity: Maximum 3 concurrent sessions
    - Once 3 sessions are booked for 3:00 PM (across all coaches), no more 3:00 PM slots available

    **Most systems DON'T have this feature** ⚠️

    **Workaround**: Use scheduler capacity settings

    - Instead of unlimited capacity per coach
    - Set max capacity = facility capacity
    - Limits total bookings regardless of coach
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Organizing schedulers for multi-coach operations

As you add coaches and session types, organization becomes critical.

### Naming conventions that scale

**Good naming patterns**:

**By Coach + Session Type**:

- "Private Training - Coach Mike"
- "Private Training - Coach Sarah"
- "Group Class - Coach David"
- "Youth Training - Coach Emma"

**By Service Level + Coach**:

- "Premium Training - Coach Mike" (\$100)
- "Standard Training - Any Coach" (\$75)
- "Intro Session - Any Coach" (\$50)

**By Specialty + Coach**:

- "Strength Training - Coach Mike"
- "Speed Development - Coach Sarah"
- "Youth Skills - Coach Emma"
- "Team Training - Coach David"

### Using program groupings

Group schedulers into logical categories for athletes:

**Example groupings**:

**"Private Training" group**:

- Private with Coach Mike
- Private with Coach Sarah
- Private with Coach David
- Private with any available coach

**"Group Sessions" group**:

- Small Group Training
- Team Practice
- Weekend Bootcamp

**"Specialized Training" group**:

- Speed & Agility (Coach Sarah)
- Strength & Conditioning (Coach Mike)
- Youth Development (Coach Emma)

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Well-organized program groupings dramatically improve the athlete booking experience when you have 10+ schedulers.
</Tip>

## Calendar management for multiple coaches

Effective calendar use is essential for multi-coach coordination.

### Using calendar filters

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter by individual coach">
    **When to use**: Checking specific coach's schedule, managing their bookings

    **How**:

    1. Go to Schedule → Calendar
    2. Use **Filter by Coach** dropdown
    3. Select individual coach

    <Frame>
      ![Coach Schedule Cal Pn](/coach-schedule-cal.png)
    </Frame>
    **Result**: See only that coach's bookings, making it easy to spot conflicts or gaps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View all coaches simultaneously">
    **When to use**: Facility-wide overview, capacity planning, conflict detection

    **How**:

    1. Go to Calendar
    2. Select "All Coaches" in filter
    3. Switch to Week or Month view for best overview

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar showing all coaches' bookings](/calendar-week-view.png)
    </Frame>
    **Result**: Color-coded by coach, see entire operation's schedule at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View facility capacity">
    **When to use**: Checking if facility is at capacity for specific times

    **How**:

    1. Calendar view (all coaches)
    2. Look at specific time slot
    3. Count concurrent sessions

    **Example**:

    - Monday 3:00 PM: 3 coaches booked
    - If facility max = 3 areas, you're at capacity
    - Can't book 4th session at 3:00 PM

    <Note>
      **Manual management**: Most systems don't automatically enforce facility capacity limits, so you'll need to monitor this yourself.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting multi-coach issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coach is double-booked at the same time">
    **Possible causes**:

    2. Coach assigned to multiple schedulers with overlapping availability
    3. System conflict prevention not working

    **How to fix**:

    - Cancel one of the bookings
    - Reassign to different coach or time
    - Review scheduler settings to enable conflict prevention
    - If using coach-specific schedulers, verify availability windows don't overlap inappropriately
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete can't find the coach they want">
    **Issue**: Too many scheduler options, athlete confused

    **Causes**:

    - Poor organization of schedulers
    - No program groupings
    - Unclear naming conventions

    **How to fix**:

    - Implement program groupings (Group by coach or session type)
    - Add clear descriptions to each scheduler
    - Consider adding photos of each coach to schedulers
    - Create a "Choose Your Coach" guide on your website

    <Tip>
      **Simplification opportunity**: If athletes frequently book the wrong coach, consider moving to "any available coach" model for standard sessions.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coach's availability not showing correctly">
    **Issue**: Coach is available but no slots showing

    **Causes**:

    - Blackout days incorrectly added
    - Availability not saved properly
    - Buffer time consuming all availability
    - Scheduler accidentally deactivated

    **How to fix**:

    - Edit coach's scheduler and verify availability settings
    - Remove inappropriate blackout days
    - Check buffer time calculations
    - Verify scheduler is active/published
    - Test booking flow to confirm slots appear

    **Debug method**: Filter calendar to only that coach and verify availability windows show properly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
