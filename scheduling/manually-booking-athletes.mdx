## When to use manual booking

Manual booking is your tool for handling scheduling situations that don't fit the standard athlete self-booking flow:

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Manual booking uses the same payment/credit logic as athlete self-booking. The only difference is who initiates the process.

## Step-by-step: Creating a manual booking

The Booking Builder has four main sections you'll complete in order:

<Frame>
  ![Manual Booking Pn](/images/manual-booking.png)
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the client">
    Search for and select the athlete you're booking for.

    **How to find clients**:

    - **Search by name**: Start typing athlete/parent name
    - **Search by email**: Type their email address

    **What you'll see**:

    - Client name
    - Email address
    - Associated tags
    - Profile picture (if set)

    **Select the athlete** by clicking on their name.

    <Note>
      Can't find the client? They may not be in your system yet. Go to **People → Clients → Add Client** to create their profile first.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the scheduler">
    Select which type of session you're booking.

    The dropdown shows all your active schedulers with:

    - Scheduler name
    - Duration (e.g., "60 min")
    - Pricing (e.g., "\$75.00" or "1 Credit")

    **Two important checkboxes appear after selecting a scheduler**:

    ### Allow custom date selection

    <Accordion title="What this does">
      When **checked**: You can book the athlete at ANY date/time, even outside your normal availability.

      When **unchecked**: You can only book within your published availability windows.

      **Use case**:

      - Checked → Special accommodation outside normal hours
      - Unchecked → Standard booking within your schedule
    </Accordion>
    ### Redeem credits

    <Accordion title="What this does">
      When **checked**: Booking will consume athlete's credits (if scheduler is credit-based).

      When **unchecked**: Booking won't consume credits—useful for comp sessions or when you want to manually handle credit deduction later.

      **Important**: Only appears if the selected scheduler accepts credits.

      **Default**: Usually checked (credits will be consumed as normal).
    </Accordion>
    <Warning>
      **Credit availability**: If athlete doesn't have enough credits and "Redeem credits" is checked, the booking will fail. Either uncheck the box (comp session) or add credits to athlete's account first.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select date and time">
    Choose when this session will occur.

    **What you'll see depends on the checkboxes**:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Booking Within Availability">
        **When "Allow custom date selection" is unchecked**:

        - Calendar shows only available dates (dates with open slots appear clickable)
        - Select a date
        - Choose from available time slots
        - Duration options: 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, or custom

        This ensures you're booking within your normal schedule and availability rules.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Booking Outside Availability">
        **When "Allow custom date selection" is checked**:

        - Calendar shows ALL dates (not just available ones)
        - Select any date
        - Manually enter ANY time (not restricted to availability windows)
        - Set custom duration

        **Use case example**: Athlete needs Tuesday 2pm session, but you're normally only available Monday/Wednesday. Check the box, select Tuesday, enter 2:00 PM.

        <Warning>
          **Conflict risk**: Booking outside availability bypasses all scheduling rules. Check your calendar to ensure you're not double-booking yourself.
        </Warning>
        <Frame>
          ![Custom date selection interface](/images/booking-builder-custom-date.png)
        </Frame>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    **Duration presets**:

    - Click **15**, **30**, or **60** for quick duration selection
    - Or set **custom duration** for non-standard session lengths

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: If booking a makeup session, match the duration to the original session they missed.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and create booking">
    Before finalizing, review all details:

    **Booking summary shows**:

    - Athlete name
    - Scheduler name
    - Date and time
    - Duration
    - Credit consumption status (if applicable)
    - Any warnings or conflicts

    **If everything looks correct**, click **"Create"** or **"Book Session"**.

    <Check>
      **Success!** The booking is created instantly. Both you and the athlete receive confirmation notifications.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## What happens after booking

### Immediate actions

1. **Calendar updated**: Booking appears on your calendar immediately
2. **Athlete notification**: Athlete receives confirmation via:
   - In-app notification
   - Email (if enabled)
   - SMS (if reminder settings configured)
3. **Credit deduction**: If "Redeem credits" was checked, credits are deducted from athlete's balance
4. **Availability blocked**: That time slot is now unavailable for other bookings (unless double-booking is enabled)

### Athlete receives

The athlete gets a booking confirmation that includes:

- Session date and time
- Session type (scheduler name)
- Duration
- Location (if set on scheduler)
- Your contact information
- Cancellation policy (if applicable)
- "Add to Calendar" option

<Note>
  The notification looks identical to a self-booked session—athletes can't tell if you booked them manually vs. they booked themselves.
</Note>

## Using Copilot for faster booking

CoachIQ Copilot can speed up the booking process by interpreting natural language:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Copilot">
    In the Booking Builder, look for the **"CoachIQ Copilot"** panel on the right side.

    <Frame>
      ![Copilot Ui Pn](/images/copilot-ui.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the booking">
    Type a natural language description:

    **Examples**:

    - "Every Tuesday at 5pm"
    - "Next Monday at 3pm"
    - "Fridays at 10am for 4 weeks"

    <Note>
      Copilot works best for recurring patterns, but can also handle single bookings.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate and review">
    Click **"Generate Availability"** and Copilot will:

    - Interpret your description
    - Auto-fill date/time fields
    - Suggest booking pattern

    Review the auto-filled fields to ensure accuracy, then proceed with booking.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Copilot tip**: Be specific with times. "5pm" is better than "evening." "Next Tuesday" is better than "soon."
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting manual booking issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Booking button greyed out or won't save">
    **Possible causes**:

    - Missing required field (client, scheduler, or date/time)
    - Athlete doesn't have sufficient credits (if "Redeem credits" checked)
    - Selected time conflicts with another booking (if double-booking disabled)
    - Selected scheduler is inactive

    **How to fix**:

    2. Check athlete's credit balance (People → Client profile)
    3. Verify no calendar conflicts at selected time
    4. Confirm scheduler is Active status
    5. Try unchecking "Redeem credits" to isolate credit issue
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete says they didn't receive confirmation">
    **Possible causes**:

    - Athlete's notification settings disabled
    - Email in spam folder
    - Incorrect contact information in athlete profile
    - System notification delay

    **How to fix**:

    1. Verify booking appears on YOUR calendar

    - "Redeem credits" checkbox was unchecked
    - Athlete credit balance wasn't refreshed after booking

    **How to fix**:

    2. View athlete's credit transaction history
    3. If credits weren't deducted but should have been:
       - Go to athlete's profile
       - Manually deduct appropriate credits
       - Add note explaining the manual adjustment
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find athlete in search">
    **Possible causes**:

    - Athlete hasn't been added to system yet
    - Typing name/email incorrectly
    - Athlete account is deactivated

    **How to fix**:

    1. Try searching by email instead of name

## Manual booking best practices

    Always check your calendar for conflicts before manually booking, especially when using custom date selection. Double-booking yourself causes major problems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate Clearly" icon="comments">
    If manually booking for someone else, confirm the date/time with them before creating the booking. Prevents confusion and reschedules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Special Cases" icon="file-alt">
    For comp sessions or exceptions, add a note in the booking details or athlete profile explaining why normal rules were bypassed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Credit Handling" icon="coins">
    Decide on your policy: Do makeup sessions consume credits? Are trials always free? Be consistent so athletes know what to expect.
