## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have functional availability templates that define when you can coach. These templates become the foundation for all your bookable sessions.

<Check>
  **Success criteria**: Your availability templates are created and ready to be connected to schedulers, generating bookable time slots for athletes.
</Check>

<Info>
  **New to availability?** Read [How Availability Works](/scheduling/how-availability-works) first to understand the concepts. This article focuses on the practical "how-to" steps.
</Info>

## Before you begin

Decide on your approach before you start configuring:

**Most coaches start here** (Recommended):

- One to two availability schedules (ex: separate availabilities for group sessions and private sessions)
- Weekly recurring pattern (same days/times each week)
- Regular coaching hours

**Advanced setup** (Add later if needed):

- Multiple availability schedules (different locations or contexts)
- Specific date availability (irregular schedules)
- Complex patterns across templates

<Tip>
  **First-timer tip**: Create ONE simple weekly recurring availability template to start. You can always create more later when you have a clear reason to do so.
</Tip>

## Method 1: Weekly recurring availability (Recommended)

This is the most common and easiest approach. Set your regular weekly schedule once, and it continues forward automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to scheduler page">
    From your dashboard:

    1. Click **Schedule** in the main navigation
    2. Click **Schedulers** from the submenu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new Availabilty">
    On the Scheduler page, locate the **Availability** and press the **plus button**

    <Frame>
      ![Availability section in scheduler builder](/availability-section.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your available days" stepNumber={3}>
    Check the boxes for the days you're available to coach:

    **Example 1: Weekday Coach**

    - ✅ Monday
    - ✅ Tuesday
    - ✅ Wednesday
    - ✅ Thursday
    - ✅ Friday

    **Example 2: Weekend Specialist**

    - ✅ Saturday
    - ✅ Sunday

    **Example 3: Flexible Schedule**

    - ✅ Monday
    - ✅ Wednesday
    - ✅ Friday
    - ✅ Saturday

    <Frame>
      ![Availability Ex Pn](/images/availability-ex.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set time ranges for each day">
    For each day you selected, set your available hours.

    **You can set different hours per day** if needed:

    - Monday: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM
    - Wednesday: 3:00 PM - 9:00 PM
    - Friday: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM
    - Saturday: 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM

    **Or same hours across all days**:

    - All selected days: 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM

    <Tip>
      **Time selection tip**: Use the dropdown or type times directly. Most systems support 15-minute increments (3:00, 3:15, 3:30, 3:45, etc.).
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Account for Time Slots Within Your Availability">
    **Important math**: Make sure your time available corresponds with the time slots you want to create later so your scheduler populates properly

    **Example**:

    - Avalability set from 5 - 9 pm
    - ✅ Sessions are 60 minutes
      - 5 - 6 pm
      - 6 - 7 pm
      - 7 - 8 pm
      - 8 - 9 pm
    - ❌ Sessions are 1 hour and 30 minutes
      - 5 - 6:30 pm
      - 6:30 - 8 pm
      - Not enough time with the availabilty set to end at 9 pm

    <Note>
      **Why this matters**: If your availability doesn't fit with the time slots offered, this will cut into your availability window, potentially preventing the last session from being bookable.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your availability template">
    **Good template names**:

    - "Private Training Sessions at Location 1"
    - "Group Training Sessions at Location 2"

    **Avoid generic names**:

    - "Availability 1"
    - "Schedule A"
    - "Template 1"

    If naming isn't available at this stage, don't worry—the availability will still work perfectly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and save">
    Before saving, verify:

    - ✅ Days selected are correct
    - ✅ Time ranges match your intended schedule
    - ✅ End times account for buffer time
    - ✅ All days have time ranges set

    Click **Save** or continue with the rest of your scheduler configuration.

    <Check>
      **Success!** You've created a weekly recurring availability template. This pattern will automatically generate available slots every week going forward.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2: Specific dates availability

Use this when you have irregular schedules, seasonal coaching, or want to test time slots for a limited period.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Availability section">
    On the Scheduler page, navigate to the **Availability** section (same as Method 1, Steps 1-2).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose 'Specific Dates' option">
    Look for and select **Specific Dates**

    This allows you to manually pick exact dates rather than recurring weekly patterns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your available dates">
    Use the date picker or calendar to select specific dates you're available.

    **Example use cases**:

    **Summer camp availability**:

    - July 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (week 1)
    - July 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 (week 2)
    - July 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 (week 3)

    **Testing new day**:

    - Every Saturday in October
    - October 7, 14, 21, 28

    **Irregular schedule**:

    - Pick specific dates that fit your variable schedule

    <Frame>
      ![Specific Dates Pn](/images/specific-dates.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **Bulk selection**: Many date pickers allow you to select multiple dates at once or select date ranges. Look for "Select Range" or similar options to avoid clicking individual dates.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set time ranges for selected dates">
    After selecting dates, set the time ranges for those dates.

    **Option A: Same time for all dates**

    - All selected dates: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

    **Option B: Different times per date** (if supported)

    - July 10: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
    - July 11: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM
    - July 12: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and save">
    Verify:

    - ✅ All intended dates are selected
    - ✅ No accidental dates included
    - ✅ Time ranges are correct
    - ✅ Dates extend far enough into future

    Click **Save** to create this specific-date availability.

    <Note>
      **Ongoing maintenance required**: Unlike weekly recurring patterns, specific dates don't extend automatically. You'll need to add more dates as time goes on.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 3: Using Copilot to generate availability

CoachIQ's Copilot AI can generate availability patterns based on plain language descriptions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Copilot in scheduler builder">
    Look for a **Copilot** panel on the side in the Availability Builder.

    <Frame>
      ![Copilot access in scheduler builder](/images/copilot-button-location.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your availability in plain language">
    Tell Copilot your schedule using natural language.

    **Example prompts that work well**:

    **Simple weekly pattern**:

    > "I'm available Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 3 PM to 8 PM"

    **Multiple time blocks**:

    > "I coach weekday afternoons 3-8 PM and Saturday mornings 9 AM to 1 PM"

    **Specific exclusions**:

    > "Available every weekday 2-7 PM except Thursdays"

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Be specific with times and days. The more detail you provide, the better Copilot can generate your availability.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Copilot's generated availability">
    Copilot will generate an availability pattern based on your description.

    **What to verify**:

    - ✅ Days are correct
    - ✅ Times match your intent
    - ✅ AM/PM is correct (not 3 AM when you meant 3 PM)
    - ✅ Pattern type (recurring vs specific dates) is right

    <Frame>
      ![Copilot generated availability preview](/images/copilot-generated-availability.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust if needed">
    If Copilot didn't get it quite right:

    - **Edit directly**: Manually adjust days or times
    - **Regenerate**: Try rephrasing your prompt and ask Copilot again
    - **Accept and tweak**: Accept the generated availability and fine-tune manually

    <Note>
      **Copilot learning**: The more you use Copilot, the better it understands your patterns and preferences.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept and save">
    Once you're satisfied with the generated availability, click \*\*Create \*\*to save your availability
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding blackout days (blocking time off)

Blackout days prevent bookings on specific dates without deleting your entire availability pattern.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access blackout day settings">
    Look for options called:

    - **Blackout Days**
    - **Unavailable Dates**
    - **Block Time Off**
    - **Exceptions**

    This is typically in the Availability section or a separate Unavailable section.

    <Frame>
      ![Blackout days section in scheduler](/images/blackout-days-section.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select dates to block">
    Use the date picker to select dates you want to block out:

    **Common blackout uses**:

    - Vacation: July 15-30
    - Holidays: Thanksgiving Day, Christmas week
    - Personal days: Doctor appointments, family events
    - Facility closures: Gym maintenance days

    <Frame>
      ![Selecting blackout dates on calendar](/images/select-blackout-dates.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **Add holidays now**: When first setting up, add all known holidays and vacation days for the next 6-12 months. This prevents athletes from booking during times you can't coach.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save blackout days">
    Click **Save** or **Add Blackout Days** to apply these exceptions.

    <Check>
      **Result**: Your regular availability continues on all other dates, but the blackout days will show no available slots to athletes.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify blackout days appear correctly">
    Check your calendar to ensure:

    - ✅ Blackout days show no available slots
    - ✅ Days before and after blackout still have availability
    - ✅ All intended dates are blocked

    <Warning>
      **Existing bookings**: Blackout days don't automatically cancel existing bookings. If athletes already booked during dates you're now blocking, you'll need to manually cancel those bookings.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating multiple availability templates

As your business grows, you may need multiple availability templates for different contexts.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Multiple Locations">
    **Your situation**: You coach at two facilities with different schedules.

    **Solution**:

    1. Create first scheduler with "Location A Availability"
       - Downtown Gym: Monday/Wednesday 5-9 PM
    2. Create second scheduler with "Location B Availability"
       - Community Center: Tuesday/Thursday 4-8 PM, Saturday 9 AM-1 PM

    **Result**: Location-specific schedulers pull from location-specific availability, preventing double-booking across locations.

    <Frame>
      ![Two schedulers with different location availability](/images/multiple-location-availability.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Different Session Types Need Different Times">
    **Your situation**: You only offer group classes on weekends but private training during weekdays.

    **Solution**:

    1. Create "Private Training" scheduler with weekday availability
       - Monday-Friday: 3-8 PM
    2. Create "Group Bootcamp" scheduler with weekend availability
       - Saturday/Sunday: 9 AM-12 PM

    **Result**: Each session type has appropriate availability without overlap or confusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: Testing New Time Slots">
    **Your situation**: You want to test offering early morning sessions without committing long-term.

    **Solution**:

    1. Keep existing scheduler with regular hours
       - "Regular Sessions": Monday/Wednesday/Friday 3-8 PM
    2. Create new scheduler with trial hours
       - "Early Morning Sessions": Tuesday/Thursday 6-8 AM (specific dates only for next month)

    **Result**: You can test demand for early mornings and easily remove if it doesn't work out, without affecting your core schedule.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Remember**: Each scheduler can have its own availability configuration. You create multiple templates by creating multiple schedulers with different availability settings.
</Info>

## Editing existing availability

Your schedule will change. Here's how to update availability for existing schedulers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your scheduler">
    1. Go to **Schedule → Schedulers**
    2. Find the scheduler you want to edit
    3. Click to open or click **Edit**

    <Frame>
      ![Edit button on scheduler list](/images/edit-scheduler-button.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Availability section">
    Scroll to the **Availability** section of the scheduler.

    You'll see your current availability configuration displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    **Common edits**:

    **Adding a day**:

    - Check an additional day box
    - Set time range for that new day
    - Save

    **Changing hours**:

    - Adjust start/end times for existing days
    - Save

    **Removing a day**:

    - Uncheck the day box
    - Save

    **Adding blackout dates**:

    - Select new blackout days
    - Save

    <Frame>
      ![Editing availability within scheduler](/images/edit-availability-settings.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Save** or **Update Scheduler**.

    <Check>
      **Changes applied**: Future available slots will reflect your updated availability. Existing bookings remain unchanged.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your calendar">
    Navigate to **Schedule → Calendar** and verify:

    - ✅ New availability shows correct slots
    - ✅ Changed hours reflect properly
    - ✅ Removed days no longer show availability
    - ✅ Existing bookings are still there

    <Note>
      **Changes are forward-looking only**: Editing availability affects future bookable slots but doesn't change or cancel existing bookings.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting availability to multiple schedulers

The real power of availability templates: one template powering multiple session types.

### The reusability workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your first scheduler with availability">
    Follow Method 1 above to create your first scheduler with your regular availability (e.g., M/W/F 3-8 PM).

    Save this scheduler.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your second scheduler">
    When creating a second scheduler:

    1. Navigate to Availability section
    2. Look for option to **Use Existing Availability** or **Select Availability Template**

    If this option exists, select your previously created availability.

    <Frame>
      ![Option to use existing availability template](/images/select-existing-availability.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **System behavior note**: Different versions of CoachIQ may handle this differently. Some automatically share availability across schedulers; others require explicit selection.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify shared availability">
    After saving your second scheduler:

    1. Check calendar in Week view
    2. Both schedulers should show available slots during the same time windows
    3. Both should reflect any changes you make to the shared availability

    <Check>
      **Success!** You're now managing one availability pattern that powers multiple schedulers.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When schedulers should have SEPARATE availability

Create different availability for each scheduler when:

- ✅ They're at different physical locations
- ✅ One is weekday-only, another is weekend-only
- ✅ Different session types are genuinely available at different times
- ✅ You're testing new time slots for one session type

**Don't create separate availability when**:

- ❌ Different session types are offered during the same hours (same availability, different schedulers)
- ❌ Only the price or duration differs (same availability works fine)
- ❌ You want to limit bookings (use booking limits instead, not separate availability)

## Common availability patterns by coaching type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Solo Personal Trainer">
    **Typical Setup**:

    - **One availability template**: "Regular Coaching Hours"
    - Days: Monday/Wednesday/Friday
    - Times: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM
    - Buffer: 15 minutes

    **Schedulers using this availability**:

    - 30-Min Quick Session - \$50
    - 60-Min Full Training - \$90
    - Free 30-Min Assessment

    **Why it works**: All services offered during same hours, manage schedule in one place.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Facility Owner (Multiple Coaches)">
    **Typical Setup**:

    - **Template 1**: "Coach Mike Hours"
      - M/W/F: 3-8 PM
    - **Template 2**: "Coach Sarah Hours"
      - T/Th: 4-9 PM, Sat: 9 AM-2 PM
    - **Template 3**: "Any Coach Available"
      - Combines both schedules

    **Schedulers**:

    - "Private with Coach Mike" → Uses Template 1
    - "Private with Coach Sarah" → Uses Template 2
    - "Private with Any Available Coach" → Uses Template 3

    **Why it works**: Clear separation by coach, plus flexibility for athletes who don't care which coach.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Team Coach">
    **Typical Setup**:

    - **Template 1**: "Team Practice Slots"
      - Monday/Wednesday: 6:00-7:30 PM only
    - **Template 2**: "Individual Sessions"
      - Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday: Variable hours

    **Schedulers**:

    - "Rising Stars Team Practice" (no self-booking, coach manually books entire team)
    - "1-on-1 Skill Development" (self-booking enabled)

    **Why it works**: Separates team commitments from individual athlete scheduling.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Seasonal/Camp Coach">
    **Typical Setup**:

    - **Specific dates only**: Not recurring weekly
    - Summer Camp Dates: June 12-16, June 19-23, June 26-30
    - Times: 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM (full day camps)

    **Schedulers**:

    - "Summer Camp - Week 1"
    - "Summer Camp - Week 2"
    - "Summer Camp - Week 3"

    **Why it works**: Limited engagement, specific dates, doesn't need ongoing weekly pattern.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting availability issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No available slots are showing when I test">
    **Possible causes**:

    1. Availability days/times not set
    2. Availability end date is in the past
    3. All time slots are blocked by blackout days
    4. Buffer time + session duration exceeds availability window

    **How to fix**:

    - Edit scheduler and verify availability is set
    - Check end date extends into future
    - Review blackout days for conflicts
    - Calculate: (session duration + buffer) × number of desired slots = minimum availability window needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I see fewer available slots than expected">
    **Possible cause**: Buffer time is consuming your availability window.

    **Example problem**:

    - Availability: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM (2 hours)
    - Session duration: 60 min
    - Buffer: 30 min
    - Expected slots: 2
    - Actual slots: 1 (only 3:00 PM works; 4:00 PM session would end at 5:00 PM but buffer would end at 5:30 PM)

    **How to fix**: Extend your availability end time to accommodate buffer after last session.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes to availability aren't showing on calendar">
    **Possible causes**:

    1. Changes not saved
    2. Browser cache showing old data
    3. Looking at wrong date range
    4. Changes only affect future, not past

    **How to fix**:

    - Re-save the scheduler
    - Refresh browser (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
    - Navigate to future dates to see new availability
    - Remember: existing bookings don't change, only future slots
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athletes can book times I didn't set as available">
    **Possible causes**:

    1. Multiple schedulers with different availability
    2. Another coach's availability overlapping
    3. Buffer time miscalculated
    4. Availability wider than intended

    **How to fix**:

    - Review all schedulers' availability settings
    - Check if multiple coaches have overlapping availability
    - Verify start/end times are correct (not AM/PM errors)
    - Double-check all checked day boxes match intent
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I can't reuse my availability across schedulers">
    **System limitation**: Some versions of CoachIQ create availability per-scheduler rather than as reusable templates.

    **Workaround**:

    - Manually configure same availability in each scheduler
    - Be extra careful to keep them in sync when making changes
    - Consider using Copilot with same prompt for each scheduler to ensure consistency
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick reference: Time calculation formulas

When planning your availability, use these formulas:

### How many slots will I have?

**Formula**:

```
Available slots = (Availability window) ÷ (Session duration + Buffer time)
```

**Example**:

- Availability: 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM = 5 hours = 300 minutes
- Session: 60 minutes
- Buffer: 15 minutes
- Calculation: 300 ÷ 75 = 4 slots

**Result**: 4 bookable time slots per day

### When should I end my availability?

**Formula**:

```
Availability end time = Desired last session start time + Session duration + Buffer time
```

**Example**:

- Last session start: 7:00 PM
- Session: 60 minutes
- Buffer: 15 minutes
- Calculation: 7:00 PM + 60 min + 15 min = 8:15 PM

**Result**: Set availability to end at 8:15 PM

### How much availability do I need?

**Formula**:

```
Minimum availability window = (Desired number of slots) × (Session duration + Buffer)
```

**Example**:

- Want 5 slots per day
- Session: 60 minutes
- Buffer: 15 minutes
- Calculation: 5 × 75 = 375 minutes = 6.25 hours

**Result**: Need at least 6.25 hours of availability to offer 5 bookable slots

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Add 15-30 minutes to calculated minimums as safety buffer for real-world schedule flexibility.
</Tip>
