<Info>
**Where to find this**: Schedule → Schedulers → [Select Scheduler] → Google
</Info>

## What you'll accomplish

Connect your Google Calendar to a scheduler so all bookings automatically appear on your personal calendar. This keeps your CoachIQ schedule in sync with your everyday calendar without manual entry.

<Note>
**Beta feature**: Google Calendar sync is currently in beta. Core functionality is stable, but some features may be refined based on feedback.
</Note>

## How the sync works

Google Calendar sync is **one-way**: CoachIQ → Google Calendar.

| Action in CoachIQ | Result in Google Calendar |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Athlete books session | Event created |
| Booking rescheduled | Event updated |
| Booking cancelled | Event removed |
| Recurring booking created | Recurring event created |

<Warning>
**Changes must be made in CoachIQ**. Editing or deleting events directly in Google Calendar does NOT update CoachIQ. Always manage bookings from your CoachIQ dashboard.
</Warning>

### What gets synced

Each booking creates a Google Calendar event with:

- Session date and time
- Athlete name
- Session type/scheduler name
- Duration

**Current behavior**: Each booking creates its own event. If 3 athletes book the same time slot, you'll see 3 separate events on your Google Calendar.

  <Step title="Enable sync">

  <Step title="Save your scheduler">

    <Check>
    **Success!** New bookings on this scheduler will now appear on your Google Calendar automatically.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key things to know

### Each scheduler syncs independently

You connect Google Calendar per scheduler, not account-wide. This gives you flexibility:

- Sync only specific schedulers to your calendar
- Connect different Google accounts to different schedulers
- Keep some schedulers private (not synced)

### Sync is one-way only

This is the most important concept to understand:

| Where you make changes | What happens |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **CoachIQ** (correct) | Changes sync to Google Calendar |
| **Google Calendar** (incorrect) | Nothing happens in CoachIQ |

If you delete an event from Google Calendar, the booking still exists in CoachIQ. If you move an event in Google Calendar, the booking time doesn't change in CoachIQ.

**Always manage your schedule from CoachIQ.**

### Recurring bookings sync correctly

When an athlete books a recurring session:

- CoachIQ creates a recurring event in Google Calendar
- The recurrence pattern matches (weekly, bi-weekly, etc.)
- Deleting the entire recurring schedule removes all instances from Google Calendar

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I sync to Apple Calendar or Outlook?">
    Google Calendar sync is the only direct integration currently available. However, if you use iCal feeds, you can subscribe to your CoachIQ calendar from Apple Calendar or Outlook. See [Calendar Overview](/scheduling/calendar-overview-and-navigation) for iCal feed options.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why don't I see past bookings?">
    Sync only applies to bookings made AFTER you enable the integration. Existing bookings before you connected won't appear on Google Calendar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can athletes see my Google Calendar?">
    No. This sync only sends events TO your Google Calendar. Athletes cannot see your Google Calendar or any events on it. They only see availability through CoachIQ's booking system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I have multiple coaches?">
    Each coach can connect their own Google account to schedulers they're assigned to. The sync sends events to whichever Google account is connected to that scheduler.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will this block time on my Google Calendar for availability?">
    The sync creates events on your Google Calendar, but CoachIQ does not read your Google Calendar to determine availability. Your CoachIQ availability is set separately in your availability templates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not appearing on Google Calendar">
    **Check these things:**

    1. Sync is toggled ON in the scheduler's Google settings
    2. You've connected a Google account (not just enabled the toggle)
    3. The booking was made AFTER you enabled sync
    4. Check the correct Google Calendar (you may have multiple)

    **Still not working?** Try disconnecting and reconnecting your Google account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Events showing wrong information">
    If event details appear incorrect (wrong time, missing info), the booking data in CoachIQ may need updating. Edit the booking in CoachIQ and the Google Calendar event will update.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cancelled booking still on Google Calendar">
    In rare cases, cancellation sync may be delayed. Wait a few minutes and refresh your Google Calendar. If the event persists, you can manually delete it from Google Calendar (this won't affect CoachIQ).
  </Accordion>
