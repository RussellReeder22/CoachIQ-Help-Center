  **Quick decision**: Most bookings (80%+) should be athlete self-booking. Use manual/recurring booking for specific situations described below.

## The three booking methods

### 1. Athlete self-booking

**What it is**: Athletes browse your available schedulers, select a time that works for them, and book themselves instantly—no back-and-forth coordination required.

**How it works**:

- Athletes visit your booking page (portal, app, or embedded on your website)
- They see your schedulers with available time slots
- They select a date/time and complete booking
- You both receive automatic confirmation

**Who can use it**: Any athlete who has:

- Sufficient credits (if credit-based scheduler)
- Payment method (if paid scheduler)
- Access to your portal/app (if not public booking)

**When to use it**:

- Regular training sessions
- Drop-in classes
- Open enrollment programs
- Any session where athletes choose their own times
- When you want to reduce administrative work

**Best for**: Starter and scaling coaches managing their calendar efficiently

<Tip>
  **Time-saver**: Athlete self-booking runs on autopilot. Once your schedulers are set up, bookings happen 24/7 without any effort from you.
</Tip>

### 2. Manual booking (coach-initiated)

**What it is**: You book athletes directly from your admin dashboard using the Booking Builder—bypassing the athlete's self-booking process.

**How it works**:

- You open the Booking Builder from your dashboard
- Select the athlete, scheduler, and time
- Confirm the booking
- Athlete receives automatic notification

**Who can use it**: Only coaches/admins (athletes cannot manually book themselves)

**Special capability**: You can book **outside your normal availability** by enabling "custom date selection"—perfect for one-off accommodations.

**When to use it**:

- VIP clients who prefer you to schedule for them
- Makeup sessions after cancellations
- Special accommodations outside normal availability
- Last-minute emergency bookings
- Athletes who need scheduling assistance
- Complimentary or comp sessions

**Best for**: Scaling coaches and facility owners managing high-touch relationships

<Note>
  Manual booking consumes credits or processes payment the same way athlete self-booking does—the only difference is who initiates the booking.
</Note>

---

### 3. Recurring bookings (coach-initiated)

**What it is**: You create multiple bookings at once in a recurring pattern (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, custom)—perfect for committed athletes with standing appointments.

**How it works**:

- You use the Booking Builder's "Recurring" section
- Define the pattern (e.g., "Every Tuesday at 5pm")
- Set duration or end date
- System creates individual bookings for each occurrence

**Who can use it**: **Only coaches**—athletes cannot book recurring sessions themselves

**Important distinctions**:

- Shows as **individual sessions** on calendar (not grouped visually)
- Each session **consumes credits separately** (if credit-based)
- You can **edit individual occurrences** without affecting the whole series

**When to use it**:

- Committed athletes with weekly standing appointments
- Team practices or regular group sessions
- Private clients who train on consistent schedule
- Subscription members with fixed time slots
- Athletes who've prepaid for multiple sessions

**Best for**: Scaling coaches and facility owners with committed long-term athletes

<Warning>
  **Credit consideration**: If booking 10 weekly sessions, athlete needs 10 credits available. Each booking consumes credits individually.
</Warning>

## Choosing the right method

Use this quick decision guide:

Does athlete need to book themselves at their convenience?

├─ YES → Athlete Self-Booking \
└─ NO → Continue 

Is this a one-time special situation?

├─ YES → Manual Booking \
└─ NO → Continue 

Is this a regular weekly/recurring commitment? 

├─ YES → Recurring Booking \
└─ NO → Manual Booking (or reconsider athlete self-booking)

<Tip>
  **General principle**: Default to athlete self-booking for scalability. Use manual/recurring booking only when there's a specific reason that requires coach initiation.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes create recurring bookings themselves?">
    **No**—recurring bookings are a coach-only feature. Athletes must book each session individually (or you create the recurring pattern for them).

    **Why**: This prevents athletes from monopolizing time slots and ensures coaches maintain control over recurring commitments.

    **Workaround**: If an athlete wants to book multiple weeks at once, you can create the recurring booking for them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do different booking methods handle credits differently?">
    **Yes**—only athlete bookings and manual bookings consume credits (if scheduler is credit-based) or process payment (if scheduler requires payment) identically.

     Recurring bookings do not have the ability to redeem credits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I manually book into times that aren't in my availability?">
    **Yes**—when using manual booking, you can enable "Allow custom date selection outside of a session's availability" to override your normal schedule.

    **Use case**: Athlete needs a session Tuesday at 2pm, but you're normally only available Mondays/Wednesdays. You can manually book this exception.

    **Athlete self-booking**: Cannot override availability—they can only book from your published available slots.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I want athletes to have standing weekly appointments?">
    **Best approach**: Create recurring bookings for them using the Booking Builder. (no credits needed, just a payment plan)

    **Alternative**: Some coaches have athletes self-book the first session, then coach creates recurring pattern for subsequent weeks.

    **Why not athlete recurring**: Prevents athletes from locking up prime time slots for extended periods without coach approval.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I convert athlete self-bookings to recurring?">
    **Not automatically**—if an athlete self-books once and wants to continue weekly, you need to create a new recurring booking pattern starting from the next occurrence.

    The original self-booked session remains separate; new recurring sessions are independent bookings.
  </Accordion>
