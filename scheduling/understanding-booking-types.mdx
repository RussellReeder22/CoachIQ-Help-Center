## What you'll learn

CoachIQ offers three distinct ways to create bookings, each designed for different coaching scenarios. Understanding when to use each method helps you manage your schedule efficiently and provide the best experience for your athletes.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Athlete Self-Booking" icon="mobile-alt">
    Athletes book themselves 24/7 through your portal, app, or website
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Booking" icon="user-plus">
    You book athletes directly for special situations or VIP clients
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recurring Bookings" icon="repeat">
    You create standing weekly appointments (coach-only feature)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Quick decision**: Most bookings (80%+) should be athlete self-booking. Use manual/recurring booking for specific situations described below.

## The three booking methods

### 1. Athlete self-booking

**What it is**: Athletes browse your available schedulers, select a time that works for them, and book themselves instantly—no back-and-forth coordination required.

**How it works**:

- Athletes visit your booking page (portal, app, or embedded on your website)
- They see your schedulers with available time slots
- They select a date/time and complete booking
- You both receive automatic confirmation

**Who can use it**: Any athlete who has:

- Sufficient credits (if credit-based scheduler)
- Payment method (if paid scheduler)
- Access to your portal/app (if not public booking)

**When to use it**:

- Regular training sessions
- Drop-in classes
- Open enrollment programs
- Any session where athletes choose their own times
- When you want to reduce administrative work

**Best for**: Starter Coaches (Jake), Scaling Coaches (Chris) managing their calendar efficiently

<Tip>
  **Time-saver**: Athlete self-booking runs on autopilot. Once your schedulers are set up, bookings happen 24/7 without any effort from you.
</Tip>

### 2. Manual booking (coach-initiated)

**What it is**: You book athletes directly from your admin dashboard using the Booking Builder—bypassing the athlete's self-booking process.

**How it works**:

- You open the Booking Builder from your dashboard
- Select the athlete, scheduler, and time
- Confirm the booking
- Athlete receives automatic notification

**Who can use it**: Only coaches/admins (athletes cannot manually book themselves)

**Special capability**: You can book **outside your normal availability** by enabling "custom date selection"—perfect for one-off accommodations.

**When to use it**:

- VIP clients who prefer you to schedule for them
- Makeup sessions after cancellations
- Special accommodations outside normal availability
- Last-minute emergency bookings
- Athletes who need scheduling assistance
- Complimentary or comp sessions

**Best for**: Scaling Coaches (Chris), Facility Owners (Mike) managing high-touch relationships

<Note>
  Manual booking consumes credits or processes payment the same way athlete self-booking does—the only difference is who initiates the booking.
</Note>

---

### 3. Recurring bookings (coach-only)

**What it is**: You create multiple bookings at once in a recurring pattern (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, custom)—perfect for committed athletes with standing appointments.

**How it works**:

- You use the Booking Builder's "Recurring" section
- Define the pattern (e.g., "Every Tuesday at 5pm")
- Set duration or end date
- System creates individual bookings for each occurrence

**Who can use it**: **Only coaches**—athletes cannot book recurring sessions themselves

**Important distinctions**:

- Shows as **individual sessions** on calendar (not grouped visually)
- Each session **consumes credits separately** (if credit-based)
- You can **edit individual occurrences** without affecting the whole series

**When to use it**:

- Committed athletes with weekly standing appointments
- Team practices or regular group sessions
- Private clients who train on consistent schedule
- Subscription members with fixed time slots
- Athletes who've prepaid for multiple sessions

**Best for**: Scaling Coaches (Chris), Facility Owners (Mike) with committed long-term athletes

<Warning>
  **Credit consideration**: If booking 10 weekly sessions, athlete needs 10 credits available. Each booking consumes credits individually.
</Warning>

## How each appears on your calendar

Understanding how bookings display helps you identify them quickly:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Self-Booked Sessions" icon="calendar-day">
    Shows athlete name, scheduler name, and time. No special indicator—looks like any regular booking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Bookings" icon="calendar-day">
    Identical appearance to self-booked. Only you know you created it manually. No visual distinction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recurring Bookings" icon="calendar-week">
    Each occurrence appears as an individual session. No "recurring" badge or grouping—they're separate bookings that can be edited independently.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Important**: CoachIQ doesn't visually distinguish between booking types on the calendar. All confirmed bookings look the same regardless of how they were created.
</Info>

## Choosing the right method

Use this quick decision guide: 

Does athlete need to book themselves at their convenience? 

├─ YES → Athlete Self-Booking └─ NO → Continue Is this a one-time special situation? 

├─ YES → Manual Booking └─ NO → Continue Is this a regular weekly/recurring commitment? ├─ YES → Recurring Booking └─ NO → Manual Booking (or reconsider athlete self-booking)

<Tip>
  **General principle**: Default to athlete self-booking for scalability. Use manual/recurring booking only when there's a specific reason that requires coach initiation.
</Tip>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes create recurring bookings themselves?">
    **No**—recurring bookings are a coach-only feature. Athletes must book each session individually (or you create the recurring pattern for them).

    **Why**: This prevents athletes from monopolizing time slots and ensures coaches maintain control over recurring commitments.

    **Workaround**: If an athlete wants to book multiple weeks at once, you can create the recurring booking for them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do different booking methods handle credits differently?">
    **No**—all three methods consume credits (if scheduler is credit-based) or process payment (if scheduler requires payment) identically.

    **The only difference**: _Who_ initiates the booking. The credit/payment mechanics remain the same.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I manually book into times that aren't in my availability?">
    **Yes**—when using manual booking, you can enable "Allow custom date selection outside of a session's availability" to override your normal schedule.

    **Use case**: Athlete needs a session Tuesday at 2pm, but you're normally only available Mondays/Wednesdays. You can manually book this exception.

    **Athlete self-booking**: Cannot override availability—they can only book from your published available slots.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I want athletes to have standing weekly appointments?">
    **Best approach**: Create recurring bookings for them using the Booking Builder.

    **Alternative**: Some coaches have athletes self-book the first session, then coach creates recurring pattern for subsequent weeks.

    **Why not athlete recurring**: Prevents athletes from locking up prime time slots for extended periods without coach approval.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I convert athlete self-bookings to recurring?">
    **Not automatically**—if an athlete self-books once and wants to continue weekly, you need to create a new recurring booking pattern starting from the next occurrence.

    The original self-booked session remains separate; new recurring sessions are independent bookings.
  </Accordion>
