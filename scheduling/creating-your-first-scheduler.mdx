## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully configured scheduler that athletes can book. This is where your availability templates become actual bookable services that generate revenue.

<Check>
  **Success criteria**: Your scheduler is created, connected to availability, configured with rules, and generating bookable time slots that athletes can see and book.
</Check>

<Info>
  **New to schedulers?** Read [What Are Schedulers?](/scheduling/what-are-schedulers) first to understand the concepts. This article focuses on the practical creation steps.
</Info>

## Before you begin

Preparation makes creation faster and reduces errors:

**Have ready**:

- Clear idea of what service you're offering
- Decided on duration (30, 45, 60 minutes, or custom)
- Decided on price (free, direct payment, or credits)
- Availability already set up (or ready to create during this process)
- 15-20 minutes of uninterrupted time

<Tip>
  **First scheduler recommendation**: Start with your most common service type. For most coaches, this is a 60-minute private session at your standard rate. Get this working first before adding complexity.
</Tip>

## The scheduler builder sections overview

Before diving in, understand what you'll configure:

**Required sections** (must complete):

1. **Basic Details** - Name, description, duration
2. **Availability** - When this scheduler can be booked
3. **Payment** - Free, paid, or credit-based
4. **Capacity** - How many athletes per session

**Optional sections** (can skip initially):

 5. **Booking Rules** - Limits, permissions, cancellation policies
 6. **Buffer Time** - Breaks between sessions
 7. **Scheduling Windows** - Minimum notice, maximum future booking
 8. **Reminders** - Automated notifications
 9. **Location** - Where sessions take place
10. **Connected Coaches** - Who delivers this service

<Note>
  **Phased approach**: Complete required sections first to get a working scheduler. Return later to add optional features as needed.
</Note>

## Step 1: Navigate to scheduler creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Schedule section">
    From your CoachIQ dashboard:

    1. Click **Schedule**, then **Schedulers** in the main left navigation menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start creating new scheduler">
    Click the **Create** **New Scheduler **button

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/create-new-scheduler.png"
        alt="Create button options"
        title=""
        style={{ width:"100%" }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure basic session details

Start with the fundamentals that define what athletes are booking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter scheduler name">
    **Field**: Session Name, Scheduler Name, or Title

    **What athletes see**: This name appears prominently when they're choosing what to book.

    **Good naming examples**:

    - "60-Minute Private Training"
    - "Small Group Strength Class"
    - "Free Initial Assessment"
    - "45-Minute Speed & Agility Session"

    **Include in name**:

    - ✅ Format (ex: Private, Group, Semi-Private)
    - ✅ Key differentiator (ex: Skill Level)
    - ✅ Location

    **Avoid in name**:

    - ❌ Internal codes (PT-60-A)
    - ❌ Overly generic ("Training Session")
    - ❌ Too long (save details for description)

    <Frame>
      ![Scheduler name input field](/scheduler-name.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **Name testing**: If you showed just the name to a stranger, would they understand what they're booking? If not, make it clearer.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add scheduler description">
    **Field**: Description, Details, or About This Session

    **Purpose**: Explain what happens in this session, who it's for, what athletes will learn/accomplish.

    **What to include**:

    - What happens during the session
    - Who this session is for (skill level, age, goals)
    - What athletes should bring or wear
    - What makes this valuable
    - Any prerequisites or requirements

    **Example description**:

    > "One-on-one personalized training focused on your specific goals. We'll work on technique, strength, conditioning, and sport-specific skills. Perfect for athletes of all levels looking to improve performance. Bring athletic shoes, water bottle, and workout clothes. Each session includes video analysis and personalized homework."

    <Note>
      **Length guideline**: 2-4 sentences is ideal. Enough to inform without overwhelming. Save very detailed information for your website or session materials.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set session duration">
    **Field**: Duration, Session Length, or Time

    **Options typically**:

    - 60 minutes (standard training, most common)
    - 90 minutes (extended training)
    - 120+ minutes (one day clinics)
    - Custom (enter any duration)

    **For your first scheduler**: 60 minutes is the safe default choice for most private training.

    <Tip>
      **Duration impacts availability**: A 60-minute session in a 5-hour availability window = ~5 bookable slots (accounting for buffer). Shorter sessions = more slots per day.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review basic details">
    Before moving to next section, verify:

    - ✅ Name clearly describes the service
    - ✅ Description is compelling and informative
    - ✅ Duration matches your intended session length

    These three fields are what athletes primarily see when deciding to book.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Connect availability

This is where you define WHEN this scheduler can be booked.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Availability section">
    Scroll down in the scheduler builder to find:

    - **Availability**
    - **Schedule**
    - **When You're Available**
    - Or similar section heading

    <Frame>
      ![Availability section in scheduler builder](/set-scheduler-availablity.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose availability">
    Select the drop menu and choose the corresponding availablity to attach to your scheduler

    <Tip>
      **Reusability reminder**: The availability you set here can power multiple schedulers. Think about it as your general coaching hours, not specific to this one service.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Start and End Dates (optional)">
    You can also customize start and end dates when clients can book with you

    **Good to use if you're:**

    - Launching a new program
    - Switching to a new schedule after a certain date

    <Frame>
      ![Current Avaliabilty Pn](/images/current-avaliabilty.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an Additional Availablity (optional)">
    If you need to attach another availability to your scheduler, you can select one from the Addtional Availability tab.

    **Good to use if you're:**

    - Switching to a new schedule at a later date

    <Frame>
      ![Time range inputs for each day](/additional-availability.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Configure payment settings

Decide how athletes will pay for this scheduler.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Free Sessions">
    **When to use**:

    - Trial/assessment sessions
    - Team practices
    - Makeup sessions
    - Building relationships

    **How to set up**:

    1. Find payment section
    2. Select **Free**

    <Check>
      **Result**: Athletes can book without any payment or credits.
    </Check>
    <Tip>
      **First scheduler tip**: If this is your very first scheduler and you're still learning, start with FREE. You can always change to paid later once you're comfortable with the system.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Direct Payment (One-Time Purchase)">
    **When to use**:

    - Drop-in sessions
    - One-time bookings
    - New athletes who haven't purchased packages

    **How to set up**:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select payment type">
        Find payment options and select **Paywall**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect or create product">
        You need a payment product:

        - Click **Select Product**
        - Choose your session product from list

        <Frame>
          ![Select Payment Scheduler Pn](/images/select-payment-scheduler.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    **Result**: Athletes must purchase the product (pay the price) to book this session.

    <Note>
      **Payment processing required**: Direct payment only works if you've connected a payment processor (Stripe) to your CoachIQ account. Set this up in Payments → Settings first.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Credit-Based">
    **When to use**:

    - Ongoing client relationships
    - Session packages or subscriptions
    - Membership models

    **How to set up**:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable credit payment">
        Find payment settings and select **Credit Charge**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set credit cost">
        Enter how many credits this session costs:

        - 1 credit (most common)
        - 2 credits (premium/longer sessions)

        <Frame>
          ![Credit cost input field](/credit-payment-scheduler.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Athletes must have credits">
        For athletes to book:

        - They need credits in their account
        - Credits come from products (packages or subscriptions)
        - You'll need to set up credit-issuing products separately

        <Tip>
          **Credit setup complexity**: Credit-based scheduling requires additional setup (creating products that award credits, understanding credit system). If this is your first scheduler, consider starting with free or direct payment.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    **Result**: Athletes redeem credits from their balance when booking.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid (Direct Payment OR Credits)">
    **When to use**:

    - Maximum flexibility
    - Accommodate different athlete preferences
    - Package holders and drop-ins both welcome

    **How to set up**:

    1. Enable BOTH payment options:
       - Connect payment product (for direct payment)
       - Enable credits with cost set
    2. Athletes choose at booking time whether to pay or use credit

    <Frame>
      ![Credit And Payment Options Pn](/images/credit-and-payment-options.png)
    </Frame>
    **Result**: Athletes can either pay the direct price or redeem a credit—their choice.

    <Frame>
      ![Session Payment Flexibility Pn](/images/session-payment-flexibility.png)
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      **Most flexible option**: Hybrid is great for established businesses but may be confusing for your very first scheduler. Start simpler, add flexibility later.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Set capacity and participant limits

Control how many athletes can book.

**Options:**

- Max booking per day: limit on the number of bookings in a day
- Max bookings per week: limit on the number of bookings in a week
- Max athletes per session (most common): limit on the number of athletes in a session

**Common settings for max athletes per session**:

- **1 athlete** = Private 1-on-1 sessions (most common for first scheduler)
- **2 athletes** = Semi-private training
- **3-6 athletes** = Small group sessions
- **8-12 athletes** = Medium group classes
- **15-20+ athletes** = Large group classes or team training

<Tip>
  **Capacity impacts pricing**: If setting capacity \>1, consider per-athlete pricing. 40 per athlete × 6 athletes = 40 \_per athlete \_×6 \_athletes \_= 240 per session (much more valuable than 1-on-1 at \$75).
</Tip>

## Step 6: Configure booking rules (optional but recommended)

These settings control how athletes can book and cancel.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cancellation Policy">
    **Field**: Allow Cancellations, Cancellation Policy, or similar

    **Options**:

    - **Allow anytime** - Athletes can cancel up until session start
    - **Require 24-hour notice** - Can't cancel within 24 hours
    - **Require 48-hour notice** - Can't cancel within 48 hours
    - **No cancellations allowed** - Once booked, no cancellation

    **Credit refund settings** (if using credits):

    - **Refund credits on cancellation** - Credit returns to athlete balance
    - **No refund** - Credit is consumed even if canceled

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: "Allow cancellation with 24-hour notice, refund credits"

    **Why**: Prevents last-minute cancellations while being fair to athletes with legitimate conflicts.

    <Tip>
      **Flexibility vs firmness**: More flexible policies attract bookings but risk no-shows. Stricter policies protect your time but may discourage booking. Find your balance.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Booking Limits">
    **Purpose**: Prevent athletes from over-booking

    **Options**:

    - **Max bookings per day** - Athlete can book max 1 (or 2, 3) per day
    - **Max bookings per week** - Athlete can book max 2 (or 3, 4, 5) per week
    - **No limits** - Athletes can book as many as they want

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: Start with no limits unless you have specific reason to restrict.

    **When to use limits**:

    - High-demand schedulers with limited slots
    - Preventing single athlete from monopolizing schedule
    - Encouraging distribution across athlete base

    <Frame>
      ![Booking limits configuration](/images/booking-limits-settings.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allow Multiple Bookings">
    **Setting**: Can athlete book multiple future sessions at once?

    **Options**:

    - **Yes** - Athlete can book Monday, Wednesday, Friday all at once
    - **No** - Athlete must book one session at a time

    **Recommended**: **Yes** (allow multiple bookings) for better athlete experience

    **Why**: Athletes with regular training schedules want to book their week at once, not one session at a time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permissions & Access">
    **Settings**: Who can book this scheduler?

    **Options available in some systems**:

    - **All athletes** - Anyone with account can book
    - **Specific groups** - Only athletes in certain programs
    - **Invite only** - You must enable access per athlete
    - **Access codes** - Athlete needs code to book

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: **All athletes** (open access)

    **When to restrict**: VIP services, specialty programs, beta testing new offerings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 7: Add buffer time

Buffer time creates breathing room between back-to-back sessions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate buffer time settings">
    Look for:

    - **Buffer**

    <Frame>
      ![Buffer Pn](/images/buffer.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set buffer before session (optional)">
    **Pre-session buffer**: Time blocked before each session starts

    **Use cases**:

    - Setup time (equipment, training area)
    - Review athlete notes
    - Personal prep time

    **Typical setting**: 5-10 minutes

    **Most coaches skip this** for their first scheduler.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set buffer after session (highly recommended)">
    **Post-session buffer**: Time blocked after each session ends

    **Use cases**:

    - Cleanup time
    - Bathroom break
    - Notes and documentation
    - Transition between athletes
    - Sessions running slightly over

    **Typical setting**: 10-15 minutes

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: **15 minutes**

    <Tip>
      **Buffer is invisible to athletes**: They only see available booking times. The buffer time happens automatically between sessions but doesn't appear on their booking screen.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand buffer impact">
    **Without buffer** (back-to-back):

    - 3:00-4:00 PM (Session 1)
    - 4:00-5:00 PM (Session 2)
    - 5:00-6:00 PM (Session 3)

    **With 15-min buffer**:

    - 3:00-4:00 PM (Session 1)
    - 4:15-5:15 PM (Session 2)
    - 5:30-6:30 PM (Session 3)

    **Result**: Proper spacing, no burnout, accommodation for sessions running over.

    <Check>
      **Verify**: Your availability end time accounts for buffer after last session. If last session starts at 7:00 PM (60 min) + 15 min buffer = need availability until 8:15 PM.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 8: Set scheduling windows (optional)

Control how far in advance (or how last-minute) athletes can book.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Minimum Booking Notice">
    **Setting**: Earliest time before session when booking is allowed

    **Options**:

    - No minimum - Can book right up to start time
    - 1 hour - Must book at least 1 hour before
    - 4 hours - Must book at least 4 hours before
    - 24 hours - Must book at least 24 hours before
    - 48 hours - Must book at least 48 hours before

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: **No minimum** OR **4 hours**

    **Why use minimum notice**:

    - Prevents last-minute bookings when you can't prepare
    - Ensures you see bookings before they happen
    - Reduces stress of surprise bookings

    **Why skip minimum notice**:

    - Maximizes booking flexibility
    - Good for urgent/emergency sessions
    - Simpler for athletes

    <Tip>
      **Start flexible, add restrictions later**: Begin with no minimum and add restrictions only if last-minute bookings become problematic.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maximum Future Booking Window">
    **Setting**: How far in the future athletes can book

    **Options**:

    - No limit - Can book months/years ahead
    - 30 days - Can only book within next month
    - 60 days - Can book up to 2 months ahead
    - 90 days - Can book up to 3 months ahead

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: **30-60 days** OR **No limit**

    **Why use maximum window**:

    - Prevents schedule from filling too far out
    - Allows flexibility to adjust pricing/availability
    - Keeps bookings manageable

    **Why skip maximum window**:

    - Accommodates athletes who plan far ahead
    - Good for seasonal businesses
    - Maximizes booking opportunities

    <Note>
      **Most coaches**: Either set no limit or 30-60 days. Very few use shorter windows unless there's specific reason.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 9: Configure reminders (optional but valuable)

Set up automated notifications before sessions to reduce no-shows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable reminders">
    Look for **Reminders** toward the bottom of the scheduler settings

    <Frame>
      ![Enable reminders toggle](/Reminders-UI.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set reminder timing">
    Choose when reminder is sent before session:

    - **30 minutes** - Last-minute reminder
    - **1 hour** - Short-notice reminder
    - **2 hours** - Moderate notice
    - **1 day** - Day-before reminder (most common)
    - **2 days** - Advance notice
    - **Custom** - Any timing you specify

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: **1 day before** (24 hours)

    **Why**: Gives athletes enough time to cancel or prepare, without being too early to forget again.

    <Tip>
      **Multiple reminders**: Some coaches set both 1-day and 1-hour reminders for important sessions. Start with just one for simplicity.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose delivery method">
    How athletes receive the reminder:

    - **In-App** - Notification in CoachIQ app/portal and inbox
    - **Announcement/Email** - Sent to athlete's email and in-app announcement feed
    - **SMS** - Text message to athlete's phone (SMS rates apply)

    **Recommended for first scheduler**: **Announcement/Email**

    **Why**: Maximum reach without SMS costs, covers both app users and email checkers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize reminder message (optional)">
    Some systems let you customize the reminder text:

    **Default message** works fine:

    > "Reminder: You have a session tomorrow at 3:00 PM with Coach Mike"

    **Custom message** example:

    > "Your training session is tomorrow at 3:00 PM! Please bring your workout gear, water bottle, and be ready to work. See you soon!"

    <Note>
      **Start with default**: Custom messages are nice-to-have, not critical for first scheduler. Default messages work perfectly well.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 10: Add location (optional)

Specify where this session takes place.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate location section">
    Find **Location:**

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/location-scheduler-ui.png"
        alt="Location configuration section"
        title=""
        style={{ width:"100%" }}
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or create location">
    **If location exists**:

    - Select from dropdown of existing locations

    **If creating new location**:

    1. Click **Add New Location**
    2. Enter location name (ex: "Main Training Facility")
    3. Enter address (optional but helpful for athletes)
    4. Add notes (ex: "Use side entrance, check in at front desk")
    5. Save location

    <Tip>
      **Virtual sessions**: If sessions are virtual, create location called "Virtual Session" or "Online via Zoom" with video link in notes.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify if location is required">
    Some schedulers may not need location:

    - Video analysis (you watch film together remotely)
    - Programming consultation (virtual)
    - Flexible location (meet at athlete's preferred gym)

    Toggle "No specific location" if applicable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 11: Assign coaches (if applicable)

Specify which coach(es) deliver this scheduler.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find connected coaches section">
    Look for **Connected Coaches**

    <Frame>
      ![Coach assignment section](/connected-coaches-ui.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select coach(es)">
    **Solo coach**: Select yourself

    **Multi-coach facility**:

    - Select specific coach if this scheduler is coach-specific
    - Select multiple coaches if any can deliver this session

    <Note>
      **If you're solo**: You can skip this section or select yourself. Most solo coaches leave this at default.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set overlapping booking permission">
    **Setting**: Can this coach be booked for multiple sessions at same time?

    **Options**:

    - **No** - Prevent double-booking (recommended)
    - **Yes** - Allow overlapping bookings (only for group sessions where coach leads multiple)

    **Recommended**: **No** (prevent double-booking) unless you specifically need overlap for group classes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 12: Review and save

Final checks before activating your scheduler.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review all configuration">
    Scroll through the entire scheduler and verify:

    **Basic Details**:

    - ✅ Name is clear and descriptive
    - ✅ Description is compelling
    - ✅ Duration is correct

    **Availability**:

    - ✅ Days and times match your schedule
    - ✅ Blackout days added for known time off
    - ✅ End time accounts for buffer after last session

    **Payment**:

    - ✅ Payment type matches intent (free/paid/credits)
    - ✅ Price is correct
    - ✅ Product connected (if direct payment)

    **Capacity**:

    - ✅ Max athletes setting matches session format
    - ✅ Group vs private is correct

    **Optional Settings**:

    - ✅ Buffer time set (15 min recommended)
    - ✅ Booking rules configured (if needed)
    - ✅ Reminders enabled (1 day before recommended)
    - ✅ Location added (if needed)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your scheduler">
    Click \*\*Create \*\*in the top right hand corner

    <Check>
      **Success!** Your scheduler is now created and will start generating bookable time slots.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your scheduler details">
    After saving, you'll be taken to the Schedulers list.

    Find your newly created scheduler and note:

    - Scheduler name
    - Duration (mins)
    - Cost per session (free, price, credit charge)
    - Booking link

    <Frame>
      ![Schedulers Overview Pn](/images/schedulers-overview.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 13: Test your scheduler

<Warning>
  **Critical step**: Always test your scheduler before sharing with athletes. This catches configuration errors before they cause problems.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your booking link">
    From the Schedulers list:

    1. Hover over your new scheduler
    2. Look for **Copy Link** button
    3. Copy the link

    <Frame>
      ![Copy booking link button](/scheduler-link.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open booking link as athlete would">
    Paste the link into a new browser tab (or incognito window to see unauthenicated view).

    **What you should see**:

    - Scheduler name and description
    - Price or credit cost
    - Duration clearly stated
    - Available time slots listed
    - Booking button or time selection

    <Frame>
      ![What athletes see when viewing scheduler](/scheduler-athlete-view.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify available time slots appear">
    Check that:

    - ✅ Days match your availability configuration
    - ✅ Times are correct (not AM when you meant PM)
    - ✅ Proper number of slots appear
    - ✅ Slots are spaced correctly (accounting for buffer time)
    - ✅ No inappropriate times showing

    <Warning>
      **If no slots appear**: Your availability isn't configured correctly. Go back and verify availability days/times are set, and date range extends into the future.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

    - Verify payment/credit information displays correctly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your calendar">
    Navigate to **Schedule → Calendar**:

## Troubleshooting common creation issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't save my scheduler (save button disabled)">
    **Possible causes**:

    - Required fields not completed
    - Invalid data in fields (negative numbers, etc.)
    - System validation error

    **How to fix**:

    1. Scroll through entire form
    2. Look for red error messages or highlighted fields
    3. Most common missing items:
       - Scheduler name
       - Duration
       - Availability (no days/times set)
       - Payment configuration incomplete
    4. Complete all required fields marked with \* or red indicators
    5. Try saving again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No available slots showing when I test">
    **Most common issue** for new schedulers!

    **Possible causes**:

    1. **No availability set** - Forgot to add days/times
    2. **Availability in past** - End date already passed
    3. **All dates blocked** - Blackout days covering everything
    4. **Buffer time too long** - Consuming entire availability window

    **How to fix**:

    - Edit scheduler → Availability section
    - Verify days are checked
    - Verify time ranges are set
    - Verify date range includes future dates
    - Check blackout days aren't blocking everything
    - Calculate: (Availability hours) ÷ (Duration + Buffer) = Expected slots
      - Example: 5 hours ÷ 1.25 hours (60 min + 15 min) = 4 slots expected

    <Tip>
      **Quick test**: Remove all buffer time temporarily. If slots appear, buffer was consuming availability. Adjust accordingly.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong times showing (AM vs PM confusion)">
    **Issue**: Slots showing 3:00 AM when you meant 3:00 PM

    **Cause**: 12/24-hour time format confusion

    **How to fix**:

    - Edit scheduler → Availability
    - Check all time fields
    - Verify AM/PM selections
    - Or switch to 24-hour format (15:00 instead of 3:00 PM) if available
    - Save and re-test
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't connect payment product">
    **Issue**: Product dropdown is empty or not connecting

    **Possible causes**:

    1. No products exist yet
    2. Product type mismatch (looking for one-time, only subscriptions exist)
    3. Payment processor not connected

    **How to fix**:

    1. Go to **Payments → Products**
    2. Verify products exist
    3. Create new product if needed:
       - Name: Match your scheduler name
       - Type: One-time purchase (for direct payment)
       - Price: Match your intended rate
    4. Return to scheduler builder
    5. Select newly created product
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete sees scheduler but can't book">
    **Issue**: Booking button disabled or error when athlete tries to book

    **Possible causes**:

    1. Insufficient credits (if credit-based)
    2. Payment processing error (if direct payment)
    3. Capacity full (unlikely for brand new scheduler)
    4. Booking limits reached (if configured)

    **How to debug**:

    - Test as athlete (what error message appears?)
    - Verify payment processing is set up
    - Check if test athlete has credits (if credit-based)
    - Review booking limit settings
    - Check scheduler status (Active/Published?)
