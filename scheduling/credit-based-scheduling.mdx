<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: Read [Credit System Explained](/scheduling/credit-system-explained) first to understand credit concepts and types (Master Credits vs Scheduler-Specific Credits) before implementing.
</Info>

## Overview: Two-step setup process

Setting up credit-based scheduling requires **two separate configurations** that link together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create credit-issuing products (Payment side)">
    **Where**: Payments → Products

    **What**: Configure products that issue credits when purchased

    **Two options**:

    - **One-Time Payment**: Issues all credits immediately upon purchase
    - **Subscription**: Issues credits per billing cycle (monthly/weekly/yearly)

    **Result**: Athletes can buy credits and receive them in their account balance

    See [Credit Products →](https://coachiq.mintlify.app/payments/credits-products)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure schedulers to accept credits (Schedule side)">
    **Where**: Schedule → Schedulers → Scheduler Settings

    **What**: Enable credit payment option on schedulers

    **Options**:

    - Credit-Only (must use credits)
    - Hybrid (credit OR direct payment)
    - Payment-Only (no credits accepted)

    **Result**: Athletes can redeem their credits when booking sessions

    See [Creating Your First Scheduler →](https://coachiq.mintlify.app/scheduling/creating-your-first-scheduler)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Critical linkage**: Products and schedulers must be linked! Configure **"Redeemable Schedulers"** in the product to specify which sessions accept those credits. If not linked, athletes can buy credits but can't use them.
</Warning>

## Testing your complete credit setup

Before launching to real athletes, thoroughly test the entire flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create test athlete account">
    Set up dummy athlete for testing:

    - **Name**: Test Athlete
    - **Email**: Your personal email (receive all notifications)
    - **Tag**: "TEST" for easy filtering
    - **Note**: Document this is a test account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant credits to test athlete">
    **Option A: Manual credit grant** (faster for testing)

    1. Open Test Athlete's profile in People → Clients
    2. Navigate to **Credits** tab
    3. Look for product-specific credit tabs OR master credits
    4. Click **"Set Credits"** or **"Add Credits"**
    5. Enter `10` credits
    6. Save

    **Result**: Test Athlete now has 10 credits from your product

    **Option B: Complete purchase flow** (comprehensive test)

    1. Get product purchase link from Products page
    2. Open link in incognito window (simulate athlete)
    3. Complete purchase using Stripe test mode
    4. Verify credits appear in Test Athlete's account
    5. Check credit transaction logged

    <Tip>
      **Stripe test mode**: Use test credit cards to avoid real charges. Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify credit display in athlete view">
    Log in as Test Athlete (or access their athlete portal).

    Navigate to **Settings → Billing** (or wherever credit balance displays).

    **Verify athlete sees**:

    - ✅ "Available Credits" section
    - ✅ Correct credit balance (10 credits)
    - ✅ Product name listed (e.g., "10-Credit Package")
    - ✅ "Redeemable Sessions" list (if scheduler-specific credits)
      - Shows which schedulers accept these credits
      - Shows usage notation (0/∞ or numeric)
    - ✅ Credit Renewals date (if subscription)
    - ✅ Credit Expirations tracking (if expiration set)

    **Red flag**: If athlete can't see credits or product name, configuration issue exists
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test booking with credits">
    As Test Athlete, navigate to booking flow:

    1. Go to **Schedule → Available** (or equivalent)
    2. Select your credit-enabled scheduler
    3. Choose date & time
    4. Proceed to payment step

    **Verify booking flow shows**:

    - ✅ "Use 1 Credit" option (or configured amount)
    - ✅ Current credit balance displayed ("You have 10 credits")
    - ✅ If hybrid: Both credit and payment options visible
    - ✅ Clear indication which payment method will be used

    5. Select **credit payment method**
    6. Confirm booking

    **Verify after booking**:

    - ✅ Session appears on calendar
    - ✅ Credit deducted (balance now 9 credits)
    - ✅ Credit transaction logged in athlete's credit history
    - ✅ Confirmation notification sent (email/SMS)

    <Check>
      **Success indicator**: Smooth booking flow, credit deducted automatically, athlete sees updated balance immediately.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test hybrid payment option">
    If you configured hybrid (credit OR payment):

    **Test scenario 1: Athlete with credits**

    1. Book session as Test Athlete
    2. **Verify**: Both options appear
       - "Use 1 Credit"
       - "Pay \$50"
    3. Test selecting CREDIT option → verify deduction
    4. Book another session
    5. Test selecting PAYMENT option → verify charge

    **Test scenario 2: Athlete with 0 credits**

    1. Use all Test Athlete's credits (book multiple sessions)
    2. Attempt to book another session
    3. **Verify**: Only payment option appears (credit option hidden)
    4. **Verify**: Can still book via direct payment

    **What this tests**: System correctly shows/hides payment options based on credit availability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test insufficient credits scenario">
    Deplete Test Athlete's credits completely:

    1. Book sessions until balance = 0
    2. Attempt to book one more credit-only session
    3. **Verify system prevents booking**
    4. **Verify error message**: "You need 1 credit to book. Purchase credits to continue."
    5. **Verify**: Link to purchase more credits provided
    6. If hybrid scheduler: **Verify** can still book via payment

    **What this tests**: System properly enforces credit requirements and guides athlete to purchase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test scheduler-specific restrictions">
    If you configured scheduler-specific credits:

    **Setup**:

    - Product A: 5 credits for "Rising Stars Class" only
    - Product B: 5 Master Credits (any scheduler)
    - Test Athlete has credits from Product A

    **Test**:

    1. Attempt to book "Rising Stars Class" → **Should work** (uses Product A credits)
    2. Attempt to book "Elite Class" → **Should fail** OR use Master Credits if available
    3. Verify athlete sees clear messaging about which credits work for which schedulers

    **Verify in Billing settings**:

    - "Redeemable Sessions" list shows correct schedulers for Product A
    - Master Credits tab shows universal usability

    **What this tests**: Scheduler restrictions working correctly, credit priority system functioning (scheduler-specific used first)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test credit refund on cancellation">
    Book a session as Test Athlete, then cancel it:

    1. Book session (1 credit deducted, balance = 9)
    2. Cancel session (within allowed cancellation window)
    3. **Verify**: Credit refunded back to balance immediately (balance = 10)
    4. **Verify**: Credit transaction logged as "Refunded for [Session Name]"
    5. **Verify**: Athlete sees updated balance

    **Test outside cancellation window** (if configured):

    1. Book session
    2. Wait until past cancellation deadline
    3. Attempt cancel
    4. **Verify**: System prevents cancellation OR credit not refunded (per your policy)

    **What this tests**: Credit refund automation working, cancellation policies enforced
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test subscription renewal (if using subscriptions)">
    For subscription products:

    **Test scenario 1: Active subscription**

    1. Test Athlete has active monthly subscription (5 credits/month)
    2. Use all 5 credits this month
    3. Wait for renewal date OR manually trigger renewal (Stripe dashboard)
    4. **Verify**: Athlete receives fresh 5 credits
    5. **Verify**: Unused credits expired OR carried over (per your settings)
    6. **Verify**: "Credit Renewals" date updates to next month

    **Test scenario 2: Cancelled subscription**

    1. Cancel Test Athlete's subscription in Stripe
    2. **Verify**: Existing credits may become unusable OR remain (depends on configuration)
    3. **Verify**: Athlete cannot book using subscription credits after cancellation
    4. **Verify**: "Redeemable Sessions" may no longer display or show as inactive

    **What this tests**: Subscription lifecycle, credit issuance automation, Stripe integration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test unlimited credits display (∞)">
    If you configured subscription with unlimited credits:

    1. Test Athlete has "Unlimited Monthly Membership"
    2. Navigate to Billing settings
    3. **Verify athlete sees**:
       - "Credit Balance: ∞" (infinity symbol)
       - "Redeemable Sessions: [Schedulers] (0/∞)" notation
    4. Book multiple sessions
    5. **Verify**: Balance still shows ∞
    6. **Verify**: Usage tracking shows "3/∞" (used 3, unlimited remaining)

    **At renewal**:

    1. Trigger next month's billing
    2. **Verify**: Usage resets to 0/∞ (fresh unlimited period)
    3. **Verify**: Previous month's bookings don't affect new month's availability

    **What this tests**: Infinity notation displays correctly, usage resets per billing period
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **All tests passed?** Your credit system is production-ready! Document any issues and retest after fixes before launching to real athletes.

    5. Test booking yourself to replicate issue
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit balance showing incorrect number">

    1. Recent booking/cancellation still processing
    2. Manual credit adjustment not saved properly

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athletes asking 'Why should I buy credits vs pay per session?'">
    **Communication problem**: Value proposition not clear enough

    **How to fix:**

    2. **Highlight convenience**: "No payment hassle at each booking—use credits instantly"
    3. **Emphasize commitment**: "Lock in your training schedule and stay consistent"
    4. **Use social proof**: "Our most popular option—90% of athletes choose packages"

    **On booking page**: Display comparison

    - Pay per session: $50 each = $500 for 10 sessions
    - 10-Credit Package: \$450 for 10 sessions
    - **You save: \$50** (bold this)

    **Visual**: Show side-by-side comparison with savings highlighted
