## Understanding the athlete credit interface

When you open an athlete's profile and navigate to the Credits section, you'll see their complete credit ecosystem organized into tabs.

### The credit tab system

**Each credit source gets its own tab:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Master Credits Tab">
    **What it shows:**

    - Universal credits usable for ANY scheduler
    - Total credits available (no restrictions)
    - Note: "These credits can be used for any session and have no restrictions"

    **Example display:**

    ```
    Master Credits
    Note: These credits can be used for any session and have no restrictions
    Credit Balance: 5
    Total: 5 Credits Redeemable
    ```

    **When to use Master Credits:**

    - Compensating athletes for issues
    - Promotional credits (referral bonuses)
    - Make-good credits (cancelled sessions)
    - Trial credits for new athletes
    - Credits that work everywhere
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Product-Specific Tabs">
    **What it shows:**

    - Product/subscription name as tab title
    - Credit balance (finite number or ∞)
    - Redeemable Schedulers list with per-scheduler usage
    - Usage limits log (if restrictions configured)
    - Credit logs for this specific product

    **Example display:**

    ```
    Month to Month Rising Stars Membership
    Credit Balance: ∞
    Limits: Usage limits log
    
    Redeemable Schedulers:
    - Rising Stars Class (3/∞)
    - Rising Stars Shooting Lab (0/∞)
    - Rising Stars Open Gym (0/∞)
    
    Credit Logs:
    [Transaction history for this product]
    ```

    **Key indicators:**

    - **∞** = Unlimited credits this billing period
    - **3/∞** = Used 3 credits, unlimited remaining
    - **0/∞** = Haven't used any for this specific scheduler
    - **Finite number** = One-time package credits remaining
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Navigation tip**: Athletes with multiple credit products will have multiple tabs. Click between tabs to see each credit source separately. Master Credits always appears as the first tab.
</Tip>

## Reading credit balances and notation

Understanding what you're looking at when you check an athlete's credits.

### Credit balance display meanings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finite Credits (5, 10, 20, etc.)">
    **Display**: Simple number like "Credit Balance: 8"

    **Meaning**: Athlete has 8 credits remaining from a one-time purchase package

    **Behavior**:

    - Decreases by 1 (or scheduler credit cost) per booking
    - Does not renew automatically
    - Athlete must purchase more when depleted

    **Example scenario**: Athlete bought "10-Credit Package" and has used 2 sessions, showing "Credit Balance: 8"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unlimited Credits (∞)">
    **Display**: "Credit Balance: ∞"

    **Meaning**: Unlimited credits WITHIN current subscription period (NOT forever)

    **Behavior**:

    - Does not decrease to zero
    - Resets at next billing cycle (monthly/weekly/yearly)
    - Active only while subscription active on Stripe

    **Example scenario**: Athlete has "Unlimited Monthly Membership" with monthly renewal, shows "∞" all month, resets next month

    <Warning>
      **Critical**: The ∞ symbol does NOT mean unlimited forever—it means unlimited until subscription renewal. If subscription becomes inactive on Stripe, these credits become unusable.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Usage Tracking (3/∞)">
    **Display**: "Rising Stars Class (3/∞)"

    **Meaning**: Used 3 credits for this specific scheduler, unlimited remaining this period

    **Behavior**:

    - Tracks usage per scheduler for subscription credits
    - Shows how frequently athlete books each session type
    - Resets at subscription renewal

    **Use case**: Monitoring which schedulers athletes use most from their subscription credits

    **Example scenario**: Athlete has unlimited monthly credits, used "Rising Stars Class" 3 times, "Shooting Lab" 0 times
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Expiration Tracking (0/5)">
    **Display**: Under "Credit Expirations" section: "10/18/2025 (0/5)"

    **Meaning**: 0 credits have expired out of 5 total issued

    **Where athletes see it**: Athlete Portal → Settings → Billing → Credit Expirations

    **Monitoring**: Helps you track if athletes are losing credits to expiration (may indicate engagement issues)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding credit logs

Credit logs provide a complete transaction history for each athlete's credits. Every credit movement is tracked.

### What credit logs show

**Location**: Athlete Profile → Credits → [Credit Tab] → Credit Logs section

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Credit Expirations">
    **Log entry format:**

    ```
    15 Aug, 12:00 AM | -3 Credits | Expired (unused)
    ```

    **What it means**: Credits expired according to product expiration rules

    **Tracking**: Helps identify athletes who aren't using credits before expiration

    **Action item**: May indicate need for engagement outreach
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Using credit logs for troubleshooting

**Common scenarios where logs help:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Athlete: 'I should have more credits'" icon="question-circle">
    **Solution**: Check credit logs to show:

    - When credits were purchased
    - When/where credits were redeemed
    - Current accurate balance
  </Card>

    - Purchase date and amount
    - How many credits used vs unused
    - Calculate fair refund amount
  </Card>
  <Card title="Disputed booking charges" icon="receipt">
    **Solution**: Credit logs confirm:

    - Whether booking used credits or charged card
    - Which session the credit was redeemed for
    - Timeline of credit usage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Subscription renewal issues" icon="sync-alt">
    **Solution**: Credit logs show:

    - Last credit renewal date
    - Whether credits refreshed after payment
    - If subscription is still active
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Manual credit operations

How to manually grant credits to athletes outside of product purchases.

### Granting Master Credits

Use Master Credits when you want to give credits that work for ANY scheduler.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to athlete profile">
    Dashboard → **People** → **Clients** → Click athlete name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Master Credits tab">
    Click the **Master Credits** tab (first tab in Credits section)

    You'll see current master credit balance and a note: "These credits can be used for any session and have no restrictions"

    <Frame>
      ![Master Credits Ui Pn](/images/master-credits-ui.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust credit amount" stepNumber={3}>
    **Input**: Number of credits to grant (e.g., "5")

    **Important**: This SETS the total, it does not ADD to existing balance

    **Math required**: If athlete has 2 credits and you want to give 5 more, enter "7" (not "5")

    <Warning>
      **Critical**: Setting credits to a lower number will REMOVE credits. Always check current balance first!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify" stepNumber={4}>
    Click **Update Redeemable Credits** button

    **Verification**: Credit balance updates immediately, new entry appears in Credit Logs:

    ```
    [Today's date] | +5 Credits | Set by [Your Name]
    ```

    <Check>
      **Success!** The athlete now has updated Master Credits available for any scheduler booking.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to grant Master Credits

**Common use cases:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Make-good credits (cancelled sessions)">
    **Scenario**: You had to cancel a session last-minute

    **Action**: Grant 1-2 Master Credits as apology/compensation

    **Communication**: "I've added 2 complimentary credits to your account for the inconvenience"

    **Why Master Credits**: Works for any session, gives athlete flexibility
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Referral bonuses">
    **Scenario**: Athlete refers a friend who signs up

    **Action**: Grant 1 Master Credit as referral reward

    **Communication**: "Thanks for referring Sarah! I've added 1 free credit to your account"

    **Why Master Credits**: Universal reward, simple to administer
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trial credits for new athletes">
    **Scenario**: New athlete wants to try your training before buying package

    **Action**: Grant 1-2 Master Credits for trial sessions

    **Communication**: "Here are 2 trial credits to try us out—book your first sessions!"

    **Why Master Credits**: Lets them sample different session types
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Promotional campaigns">
    **Scenario**: Running a "Summer Kickoff" promotion

    **Action**: Grant 1 Master Credit to all active athletes

    **Communication**: "Summer special—everyone gets 1 free credit!"

    **Why Master Credits**: Broad applicability, simple bulk operation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fixing credit errors">
    **Scenario**: Athlete was accidentally charged for a session that should have used credits

    **Action**: Grant credits equal to the value they should have used

    **Communication**: "I've added credits to your account to correct the billing error"

    **Why Master Credits**: Quick fix, doesn't require product reconfiguration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Granting product-specific credits

For adding credits tied to specific products/subscriptions.

### When to use product-specific vs Master Credits

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Master Credits When...">
    ✅ **Quick fixes** - One-off compensation or promotional credits\
    ✅ **Flexibility needed** - Athlete should be able to use for ANY scheduler\
    ✅ **Trial credits** - New athletes sampling your services\
    ✅ **Make-goods** - Compensating for service issues\
    ✅ **Simple management** - Don't want to track credit sources

    **Bottom line**: Master Credits are simpler and more flexible for most manual operations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use Product-Specific Credits When...">
    ✅ **Package extensions** - Athlete bought 10-pack, you're adding 2 bonus credits to that package\
    ✅ **Subscription supplements** - Adding extra credits to their monthly subscription this cycle\
    ✅ **Tracking required** - Need to know which product/subscription credits came from\
    ✅ **Scheduler restrictions matter** - Credits should only work for specific schedulers\
    ✅ **Maintaining credit separation** - Keep different credit types separate for reporting

    **Bottom line**: Product-specific credits maintain tighter control and tracking
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding product-specific credits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to athlete profile">
    Dashboard → **People** → **Clients** → Click athlete name → **Credits** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select product-specific tab">
    Click the tab for the product/subscription you want to add credits to

    **Example**: "10-Credit Standard Package" or "Monthly Unlimited Membership"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually add product to athlete (if needed)">
    If athlete doesn't have the product yet:

    1. Click **\+ Add Product** (or similar button in athlete profile)
    2. Select the product from dropdown
    3. Choose whether to charge athlete or add without payment

    <Warning>
      **Payment consideration**: Adding product manually can optionally charge the athlete via Stripe, or add without charging (credits stay live until you remove product)
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust credit balance">
    Follow same process as Master Credits:

    1. Click **Edit** next to credit balance
    2. Enter new total (remember: this SETS the total)
    3. Save changes

    **Result**: Credit logs will show: "[Date] | +X Credits | Set by [Coach Name]"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Edge case**: Manually adding a product to an athlete WITHOUT charging them keeps those credits live indefinitely (until you remove the product). This is useful for:

  - Staff/family complimentary access
  - Long-term sponsorships
  - Special VIP arrangements
</Note>

## Common credit management scenarios

Real-world situations you'll encounter and how to handle them.

### Scenario 1: Athlete requests refund on unused credits

**Situation**: Athlete bought 10-credit package, used 3, wants refund on remaining 7

**Steps to handle:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check credit logs">
    Verify purchase date, credits used, credits remaining

    **Navigate**: Athlete Profile → Credits → [Product Tab] → Credit Logs

    **Document**:

    - Purchase date and amount paid
    - Credits used (3)
    - Credits remaining (7)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate refund amount">
    **Formula**: (Remaining credits ÷ Total credits) × Purchase price

    **Example**: (7 ÷ 10) × $450 = $315 refund

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Deduct credit card processing fees (2.9% + \$0.30) from refund if your policy includes that clause
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process refund via Stripe">
    Navigate to **Payments** → **Transactions** → Find original purchase → Issue partial refund

    **Amount**: \$315 (or your calculated amount)

    <Note>
      **Refund policy recommendation**: Clearly state refund terms in your product descriptions and website terms of service
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove unused credits from athlete account">
    **Action**: Set credit balance to 0 for that product

    **Why**: Prevents athlete from using refunded credits

    **Credit log entry**: Will show credits were removed by coach
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Scenario 2: Athlete ran out of credits but wants to book

**Situation**: Athlete has 0 credits, wants to book a credit-only scheduler

**Options to offer:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Purchase More Credits">
    **Best for**: Athlete planning to continue training regularly

    **Your action**:

    1. Send direct link to credit package purchase
    2. Or: Navigate to athlete's account → Products → Assign product and charge

    **Communication**: "You're out of credits! Purchase another package to continue booking: [link]"

    **Benefit**: Athlete gets best value via package discount
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Temporarily Grant Credits">
    **Best for**: One-time booking need, athlete is loyal/long-term

    **Your action**: Grant 1-2 Master Credits to cover immediate booking

    **Communication**: "I've added 1 credit to your account to book today's session. Let's discuss package options for the future!"

    **Risk**: Sets precedent that they can run out and get free credits

    <Warning>
      **Use sparingly**: Only for exceptional athletes/situations, or this becomes expected
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 3: Convert to Direct Payment">
    **Best for**: Scheduler configured for hybrid payment (credits OR direct payment)

    **Your action**: Manually book the athlete and charge their card directly

    **Communication**: "Since you're out of credits, I can charge your card \$50 for today's session"

    **Benefit**: Athlete can still train while deciding about package purchase
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### Scenario 3: Subscription credits not renewing

**Situation**: Athlete has monthly subscription, credits show as expired/empty instead of renewing

**Troubleshooting steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify subscription status on Stripe">
    Navigate to **Payments** → **Subscriptions** → Find athlete's subscription

    **Check**:

    - Is subscription "Active" on Stripe?
    - Did most recent payment succeed?
    - Is subscription cancelled but still in active period?

    <Warning>
      **Common issue**: Subscription inactive on Stripe = credits unusable, even if balance exists
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check credit renewal date">
    Athlete Profile → Credits → [Subscription Tab]

    **Look for**: "Credit Renewals: [Date]"

    **Compare**: Is renewal date in the past? Should have renewed by now?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify payment method">
    Athlete may have expired credit card causing payment failures

    **Action**: Request athlete update payment method in Athlete Portal → Settings → Billing → Saved Cards
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual renewal if subscription active">
    If subscription shows active on Stripe but credits didn't renew:

    1. Navigate to athlete's subscription tab in credits
    2. Manually set credits to the subscription amount (e.g., 12 for monthly 12-credit subscription)
    3. Contact support if issue persists

    <Note>
      **Document the issue**: Screenshot subscription status and credit renewal date to share with CoachIQ support if needed
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Scenario 4: Athlete wants to transfer credits to another athlete

**Situation**: Athlete moving away, wants to gift remaining credits to a teammate

**Policy decision required**: Does your business allow credit transfers?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="If You Allow Transfers">
    **Steps:**

    1. Check original athlete's credit balance
    2. Note credit source (Master vs product-specific)
    3. Remove credits from original athlete (set balance to 0)
    4. Grant same credits to receiving athlete
    5. Document transaction in both athletes' profiles

    **Communication to both athletes**:

    - "I've transferred 5 credits from [Athlete A] to [Athlete B] as requested"
    - Include in both athletes' credit logs for transparency

    <Tip>
      **Best practice**: Require written confirmation from BOTH athletes via email before transferring
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="If You Don't Allow Transfers">
    **Alternative solution**: Offer partial refund instead

    **Communication**: "Our policy doesn't allow credit transfers, but I can offer you a [X%] refund on unused credits, or you could gift them by purchasing another package for your teammate"

    **Why this policy**:

    - Prevents abuse (buying packages to resell credits)
    - Maintains revenue integrity
    - Simplifies accounting

    <Note>
      **Legal consideration**: Check local regulations—some jurisdictions require refunds on stored value/unused credits
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Bulk credit operations

Managing credits for multiple athletes at once.

### Viewing all athlete credit balances

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to People section">
    Dashboard → **People** → **Clients**

    You'll see list of all athletes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credit Balance column (if available)">
    Look for column customization options to display credit balances

    <Note>
      **Platform note**: If credit balance column isn't available in list view, you'll need to check each athlete individually. Consider requesting this feature from CoachIQ support.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by credit balance">
    **Use cases:**

    - Find athletes with 0 credits (need renewal outreach)
    - Find athletes with low credits (send purchase reminders)
    - Identify athletes with high unused credits (engagement issue?)

    **Workaround if no filters**: Export athlete list and manually track in spreadsheet
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk credit grants

**Scenario**: You want to give 1 free credit to all active athletes for a promotion

**Current limitation**: CoachIQ may not have built-in bulk credit grants

**Workaround options:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Use Automations">
    If available, create automation:

    **Trigger**: Athlete has specific tag (e.g., "Active Athlete")\
    **Action**: Grant 1 Master Credit

    **Setup**:

    1. Dashboard → Tools → Automations → Create New
    2. Set trigger (tag-based or date-based)
    3. Set action: Add credits
    4. Activate automation

    <Check>
      **Best option**: Automated, scalable, trackable
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Manual Individual Grants">
    **Process**:

    1. Create list of athletes to receive credits
    2. Go through each athlete profile
    3. Manually grant credits as described above
    4. Track completion in spreadsheet

    **Time estimate**: ~30 seconds per athlete

    **For 50 athletes**: ~25 minutes

    <Warning>
      **Risk**: Human error, missed athletes, time-consuming
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 3: Create Promotional Product">
    **Clever workaround**:

    1. Create a \$0 product that issues credits
    2. Manually add product to each athlete (no charge)
    3. Credits issued automatically via product

    **Benefits**:

    - Trackable via product
    - Clean credit logs
    - Can remove product later to revoke credits if needed

    <Tip>
      **Most scalable**: For large athlete bases, this method provides best tracking and control
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Proactive credit management

Preventing issues before they occur.

### Low-balance monitoring

**Goal**: Contact athletes before they run out of credits

**Strategy:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Weekly Credit Review" icon="calendar-week">
    **Every Monday**:

    1. Check which athletes have ≤2 credits remaining
    2. Send friendly reminder: "You have 2 credits left—book your next session or grab another package!"
    3. Include direct purchase link

    **Result**: Proactive renewals, fewer "I'm out of credits" emergency requests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Low-Balance Alerts" icon="bell">
    **Set up automation** (if available):

    **Trigger**: Athlete credit balance ≤ 2\
    **Action**: Send email/SMS with purchase link

    **Message**: "Hey [Name]! You're running low on credits (only 2 remaining). Stock up now: [link]"

    **Result**: Hands-off renewal prompts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Post-Purchase Check-In" icon="comments">
    **After athlete buys package**:

    1. Send confirmation message
    2. Remind them of credit balance
    3. Encourage booking next sessions

    **Example**: "Your 10-credit package is loaded! You now have 10 credits ready to use. Book your next session here: [link]"

    **Result**: Immediate engagement, credits don't sit unused
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monthly Credit Reports" icon="chart-bar">
    **Generate monthly**:

    - Total credits sold (revenue)
    - Total credits redeemed (sessions delivered)
    - Outstanding credit liability (credits not yet used)

    **Health metric**: Credits sold ≥ credits redeemed = healthy cash flow

    **Warning sign**: Credits redeemed \> credits sold = burning through old inventory

    **Action**: Adjust sales strategy if credits being consumed faster than purchased
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Engagement monitoring via credit usage

**Credit logs reveal athlete engagement patterns:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Athlete bought credits but never used them">
    **Red flag**: Purchased package 30+ days ago, 0 credits redeemed

    **Possible reasons**:

    - Intimidated/nervous to book
    - Changed mind but didn't request refund
    - Scheduling difficulty
    - Forgot they purchased

    **Action**:

    1. Reach out personally: "I noticed you haven't booked yet! Any questions or concerns?"
    2. Offer to manually book first session together
    3. Provide extra support/encouragement

    **Goal**: Convert purchase into active athlete
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete stopped using credits mid-package">
    **Red flag**: Used 4 of 10 credits, then no activity for 14+ days

    **Possible reasons**:

    - Lost motivation
    - Injury/illness
    - Life changes
    - Dissatisfaction with training

    **Action**:

    1. Check-in message: "Haven't seen you lately—everything okay?"
    2. Offer flexible scheduling
    3. Ask for feedback (anonymously if preferred)
    4. Remind them of remaining credit value

    **Goal**: Re-engage before they consider refund request
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Athlete consistently lets credits expire">
    **Red flag**: Pattern of buying packages, using 50-70%, letting rest expire

    **Possible reasons**:

    - Overcommitting (buying too large a package)
    - Inconsistent schedule
    - Wrong package size for their training frequency

    **Action**:

    1. Recommend smaller package size
    2. Discuss realistic training frequency
    3. Offer no-expiration policy to reduce pressure
    4. Switch to pay-per-session if they prefer flexibility

    **Goal**: Right-size their commitment to actual usage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting credit issues

Common problems and solutions.

### Issue: Athlete says credits aren't showing in app

**Troubleshooting checklist:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify credits exist in coach dashboard">
    Navigate to athlete profile → Credits section

    **Check**: Do you see credits in their account?

    **If NO credits visible**: Credits don't exist—athlete may be confused or checking wrong account

    **If credits ARE visible**: Continue to next step
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check subscription status (if subscription credits)">
    For subscription-based credits:

    **Verify**: Payments → Subscriptions → Is subscription "Active" on Stripe?

    **If inactive**: Credits become unusable even if balance shows in coach dashboard

    **Solution**: Athlete must resolve payment issue or reactivate subscription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify product is linked to schedulers">
    Credits may exist but not work for the scheduler athlete is trying to book

    **Check**:

    1. Athlete's credit tab → "Redeemable Schedulers" list
    2. Is the scheduler they want listed there?

    **If NOT listed**: Credits are restricted to other schedulers

    **Solution**: Grant Master Credits or add scheduler to product's redeemable list ([Article #24](/scheduling/setting-up-credit-packages))
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask athlete to refresh app/logout">
    **Technical fix**:

    1. Log out of mobile app completely
    2. Log back in
    3. Check if credits now visible

    **Why this works**: App data sync issue resolved by fresh login

    <Tip>
      **Quick test**: Have athlete check credits on web browser (Athlete Portal). If visible there but not in app, it's definitely an app sync issue.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify athlete is logged into correct account">
    **Common issue**: Athlete has multiple accounts (old email + new email)

    **Check**: Ask athlete what email they're logged in with

    **Solution**: Consolidate accounts or transfer credits to correct account
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Issue: Credit logs don't match athlete's memory

**Example**: Athlete insists they had 8 credits, logs show only 5 purchased

**Resolution process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review complete credit log history">
    Show athlete their credit logs with specific dates/amounts

    **Explain each transaction**:

    - "+10 Credits | Purchased [Product Name]" = When they bought
    - "-1 Credits | Redeemed for [Scheduler]" = When they used
    - Current balance = Simple math

    <Note>
      **Transparency builds trust**: Walk through logs together, show it's all tracked
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for multiple accounts">
    Athlete may have purchased on different email/account

    **Ask**: "Have you used any other email addresses to sign up or purchase?"

    **Action**: Search for athlete by alternate emails, check if credits exist elsewhere
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Stripe transactions">
    If athlete insists they paid for credits not showing:

    **Verify**: Payments → Transactions → Search for athlete's purchases

    **Compare**: What Stripe shows vs what credit logs show

    **Mismatch**: If Stripe shows payment but no credits issued, this is a system error—grant credits and contact support
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer benefit of the doubt (once)">
    If discrepancy is small (1-2 credits) and athlete is loyal/long-term:

    **Action**: Grant the disputed credits as goodwill gesture

    **Communication**: "I don't see it in the logs, but I trust you—I've added 2 credits to your account"

    **Caveat**: Only do this once per athlete. Repeated disputes may indicate:

    - Genuine system issue (report to CoachIQ)
    - Athlete confusion/misunderstanding
    - Potential fraud attempt

    <Warning>
      **Set boundary**: "I've added these credits this time, but please keep track of your bookings going forward. Our system logs are very accurate."
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Issue: Athlete wants credits to never expire

**Scenario**: Athlete upset that credits have expiration date, wants indefinite validity

**Resolution strategies:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Policy Explanation">
    **Your response**:

    "Our credit packages expire after [X months] to encourage consistent training. Here's why:

    1. **Training effectiveness**: Regular training is more effective than sporadic sessions months apart
    2. **Business operations**: Expiration dates help us plan capacity and manage inventory
    3. **Fair pricing**: We can offer package discounts because most credits are used within timeframe
    4. **Market standard**: Similar to gym memberships, fitness classes, and other package deals

    **Your options**:

    - Use credits within expiration window
    - We can extend once as courtesy (if you offer this)
    - Or: Purchase shorter-term packages that fit your actual training frequency"

    <Tip>
      **Empathy + firmness**: Understand frustration, but maintain policy
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="One-Time Extension">
    **If you choose to be flexible**:

    "I understand—I'll extend your credits as a one-time courtesy. Your 5 remaining credits will now expire [X months from now] instead of [original date]."

    **How to do this**:

    1. You CANNOT extend expiration dates directly in CoachIQ
    2. **Workaround**: Remove expiring credits, grant fresh Master Credits (no expiration)

    **Communication**: "I've converted your expiring credits to Master Credits with no expiration"

    <Warning>
      **Risk**: Sets precedent that expiration is negotiable. Use sparingly.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Offer No-Expiration Products">
    **Long-term solution**: Create product tier without expiration

    **Product setup**:

    - "Flexible 10-Credit Package - No Expiration - \$500"
    - Price slightly higher to offset indefinite liability

    **Communication**: "If you prefer flexibility, I offer no-expiration packages at a slightly higher rate to account for the extended value"

    **Business benefit**: Accommodates flexible athletes while protecting revenue

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete credit logs?">
    **Short answer**: No

    **Why**: Credit logs are permanent transaction records for accounting and transparency

    **What you CAN do**:

    - Remove credits from athlete's balance (sets to 0)
    - Delete the product from their account
    - Issue refunds via Stripe

    **What you CANNOT do**:

    - Erase credit log history
    - Hide specific transactions

    **Reason**: Financial integrity and audit trail preservation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to credits if I delete athlete account?">
    **Result**: All credit logs are permanently deleted when athlete is deleted

    **Warning**: This is irreversible—credits and all transaction history are lost

    **Before deleting athlete**:

    1. Screenshot credit balances and logs if needed for records
    2. Process any pending refunds
    3. Confirm athlete has no outstanding credits they're owed

    <Warning>
      **Liability consideration**: Deleting athlete with unused credits may create refund obligation. Resolve credits first.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athlete see their own credit logs?">
    **Yes**: Athletes can view their credit logs in Athlete Portal

    **Location for athletes**: Athlete Portal → Settings → Billing → Credit Logs section

    **What they see**:

    - Credit Balance
    - Credit Renewals date
    - Credit Expirations tracking
    - Redeemable Sessions list
    - Credit Logs with transaction history

    **Benefit**: Self-service transparency reduces "where did my credits go?" questions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I track total outstanding credit liability?">
    **What is credit liability?**: Total value of credits sold but not yet used (sessions you owe)

    **Manual calculation**:

    1. Sum all athlete credit balances across all athletes
    2. Multiply by your average session value
    3. Result = total outstanding liability

    **Example**:

    - 50 athletes × 5 average credits each = 250 total outstanding credits
    - 250 credits × $45 per session value = $11,250 liability

    **What this means**: If all athletes used all credits immediately, you'd need to deliver \$11,250 worth of sessions

    **Healthy ratio**: Outstanding credits should be ≤ 2 months of typical credit sales

    **Warning sign**: Liability growing faster than you're delivering sessions = overselling capacity

    <Note>
      **Feature request**: Ask CoachIQ support for built-in credit liability reporting dashboard
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I offer store credit or refunds?">
    **Policy decision**: Each has pros/cons

    **Store credit (keeping money in business)**:

    - ✅ Retains revenue
    - ✅ Keeps athlete engaged
    - ✅ Simpler than refunds
    - ❌ Athlete may feel trapped
    - ❌ Some jurisdictions require cash refunds

    **Cash refunds**:

    - ✅ Athlete satisfaction
    - ✅ Legal compliance
    - ✅ Builds goodwill
    - ❌ Lose revenue
    - ❌ Credit card fees often non-refundable

    **Recommended hybrid policy**:

    - Within 7 days of purchase: Full cash refund
    - After 7 days but unused: Store credit or partial refund (minus processing fees)
    - Credits partially used: Pro-rated refund only

    **Communicate clearly**: Post this policy on your website and product pages
