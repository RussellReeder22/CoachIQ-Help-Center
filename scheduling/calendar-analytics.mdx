## Scheduler breakdown

This table shows performance metrics for each of your schedulers.

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Scheduler Name** | The name of each scheduler |
| **Bookings** | Total number of bookings in the selected period |
| **Capacity** | Total available slots across all sessions |
| **Fill Rate %** | Percentage of available capacity that was booked |
| **Cancel Rate** | Percentage of bookings that were canceled |

### Reading the data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High fill rate, low cancel rate">
    **Example**: 95% fill rate, 5% cancel rate

    **What it means**: This scheduler is performing well. Demand is high and athletes are committed.

    **Action**: Consider raising prices or adding more availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low fill rate">
    **Example**: 40% fill rate

    **What it means**: You have more capacity than demand for this scheduler.

    **Possible actions**:
    - Reduce availability (fewer time slots)
    - Lower price to increase demand
    - Improve marketing for this service
    - Consider discontinuing if consistently underperforming
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High cancel rate">
    **Example**: 30%+ cancel rate

    **What it means**: Athletes are booking but frequently canceling.

    **Possible actions**:
    - Review and tighten cancellation policy
    - Send more reminders before sessions
    - Investigate if specific athletes are chronic cancelers
    - Check if the scheduler timing conflicts with common schedules
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="100% fill rate">
    **Example**: 100% fill rate every period

    **What it means**: You're fully booked—possibly leaving revenue on the table.

    **Action**: Add more availability or raise prices to balance demand.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Coach breakdown

If you have multiple coaches, this section shows how bookings are distributed across your team.

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Coach** | Coach name and avatar |
| **Total Bookings** | Number of sessions booked with this coach |
| **Total Capacity** | Total available slots for this coach |
| **Fill Rate %** | Percentage of the coach's capacity that was booked |

### Using coach data

**Identify top performers**: Coaches with high fill rates are in demand. Consider:
- Having them mentor other coaches
- Raising their session prices
- Giving them more availability

**Support underperformers**: Coaches with low fill rates may need:
- More training or development
- Better marketing/visibility
- Schedule adjustments to more popular times
- Review of athlete feedback

**Balance workload**: Ensure bookings are distributed fairly to prevent burnout and maintain quality.

## Cancellation insights

The bottom section highlights cancellation patterns to help you reduce no-shows and lost revenue.

### Top athletes for cancellations

Lists the athletes who cancel most frequently.

**How to use this**:
- Have a conversation with chronic cancelers about commitment
- Consider stricter cancellation policies for repeat offenders
- Investigate if there's a pattern (always cancels Mondays? Specific scheduler?)
- Decide if the athlete is a good fit for your business

### Top schedulers for cancellations

Shows which schedulers have the highest cancellation rates.

**Common causes of high scheduler cancellation rates**:
- **Inconvenient timing**: Sessions at awkward hours
- **Too far in advance**: Athletes forget about sessions booked weeks out
- **Wrong audience**: Scheduler attracting uncommitted athletes
- **Pricing mismatch**: Athletes booking then getting price shock

**Actions to take**:
- Review scheduler settings and timing
- Shorten the booking window (e.g., 14 days instead of 30)
- Add more reminders before sessions
- Require prepayment or deposits

## Filtering your data

Use the **date range selector** (top right) to view analytics for specific periods:

- **Last 7 days**: Recent performance snapshot
- **Last 30 days**: Monthly trends (default view)
- **Last 90 days**: Quarterly patterns
- **Custom range**: Specific dates for detailed analysis

<Tip>
**Compare periods**: Check analytics for the same period across different months to identify seasonal patterns. Is summer slower? Do cancellations spike around holidays?
</Tip>
