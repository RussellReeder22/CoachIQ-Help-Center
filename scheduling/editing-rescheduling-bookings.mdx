## Editing a Booking

You can update booking details like notes, assigned coach, or location without changing the time.

1. Go to **Scheduling** in the left sidebar
2. Click on the booking you want to edit
3. In the booking detail panel, click **Edit**
4. Make your changes (notes, coach assignment, location, etc.)
5. Click **Save**

## Rescheduling a Booking

To move a booking to a different date or time:

1. Go to **Scheduling** in the left sidebar
2. Click on the booking you want to reschedule
3. Click **Reschedule**
4. Select the new date and time from available slots
5. Click **Confirm**

<Note>

Athletes will automatically receive a notification when their session is rescheduled.

</Note>

## Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling

For quick rescheduling on the calendar view:

1. Switch to **Week** or **Day** view on your calendar
2. Click and hold the booking you want to move
3. Drag it to the new time slot
4. Release to confirm the new time

<Warning>

Drag-and-drop rescheduling bypasses availability checks. Make sure the new time works for both the coach and athlete.

</Warning>

## What Athletes See

When you reschedule a booking:
- Athletes receive an email notification with the new date/time
- The updated session appears in their Athlete Portal
- Any calendar invites are automatically updated
