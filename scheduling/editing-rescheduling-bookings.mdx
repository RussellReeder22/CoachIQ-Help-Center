## Drag-and-drop rescheduling

  <Step title="Switch to Week or Day view">
    Use the view toggles at the top of your calendar to switch to **Week** or **Day** view.

    <Frame>

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag the booking">
    Click and hold the booking you want to move, then drag it to the new time slot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Release to confirm">
    Drop the booking on the desired time. The change saves automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Drag-and-drop rescheduling bypasses availability checks. Make sure the new time works for both the coach and athlete before moving.
</Warning>

## What athletes see

When you reschedule a booking:

- **Email notification** — Athletes receive an email with the new date/time
- **Portal update** — The updated session appears in their Athlete Portal immediately
- **Calendar sync** — Any linked calendar invites are automatically updated

<Tip>
**Best practice**: If making a significant time change, send a personal message through the Inbox to confirm the athlete can make the new time.
</Tip>
