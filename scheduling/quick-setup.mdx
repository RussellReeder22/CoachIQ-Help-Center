## Use this checklist before going live

Before you share your booking link with athletes, use this checklist to verify everything is configured correctly. Catching issues now prevents confusion, failed bookings, and frustrated athletes later.

<Info>
  **Estimated time**: 5-10 minutes to complete this checklist
</Info>

## Phase 1: Account & Platform Setup

These are one-time setup items that affect all your scheduling.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Account & Payment Processing">
    **What to verify**:

    - CoachIQ account is active and accessible
    - Payment processing is connected (if using paid sessions)
    - Bank account linked for payouts (if using paid sessions)
    - Test payment processed successfully (if using paid sessions)

    **Why it matters**: Without payment processing set up, athletes can't complete paid bookings.

    **How to check**: Go to **Payments → Settings** and verify your payment processor is connected and active.

    <Tip>
      **First-timer tip**: If you're starting with free sessions, you can skip payment setup for now and add it later when you're ready to monetize.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Timezone Settings">
    **What to verify**:

    - Your timezone is set correctly in account settings
    - Calendar displays times in your correct timezone

    **Why it matters**: Incorrect timezone settings cause scheduling chaos—athletes booking at wrong times, missed sessions, confusion all around.

    **How to check**:

    1. Go to **Settings → Account Settings**
    2. Verify timezone matches your location
    3. Check calendar to confirm displayed times are correct

    **Common mistake**: Forgetting to update timezone after traveling or relocating.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Athlete List">
    **What to verify**:

    - At least one test athlete added to your system
    - Test athlete has valid email address
    - You can access athlete portal/app to see their view

    **Why it matters**: You need a test athlete to properly verify the booking experience before going live.

    **How to check**: Go to **People → Athletes** and confirm you have at least one athlete listed.

    <Note>
      **Create a test athlete**: Use your own email (or a test email) to create a fake athlete so you can test bookings without bothering real athletes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 2: Scheduler Configuration

Verify your scheduler (session type) is configured correctly.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Session Details Are Clear & Compelling">
    **What to verify**:

    - Session name is descriptive and includes duration
    - Description explains what athletes will get/learn
    - Duration is set correctly (30, 45, 60 min, etc.)
    - Session type matches your coaching style (1-on-1 vs group)

    **Good session name examples**:

    - ✅ "60-Minute Private Hitting Lesson"
    - ✅ "45-Minute Small Group Speed Training"
    - ✅ "30-Minute Free Assessment Session"

    **Weak session name examples**:

    - ❌ "Session 1"
    - ❌ "Training"
    - ❌ "PT-60-A"

    **How to check**: View your scheduler in the Schedulers list—does it clearly communicate what athletes are booking?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Availability Is Set Correctly">
    **What to verify**:

    - Days and times match when you actually want to coach
    - Availability extends far enough into the future
    - No accidental gaps or missing days
    - Blackout days are set for known time off (vacation, holidays)

    **Common mistakes**:

    - Setting availability only 1-2 weeks out (athletes can't book far ahead)
    - Forgetting to block vacation days
    - AM/PM confusion (setting 3:00 AM instead of 3:00 PM)
    - Not accounting for time zone differences

    **How to check**:

    1. Go to **Schedule → Calendar**
    2. Switch to Week or Month view
    3. Verify available slots appear on correct days/times

    <Warning>
      **Critical check**: Look at your calendar for the next 2-4 weeks. Do available slots appear when you expect them? If you see gaps or wrong times, edit your availability.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Buffer Time Is Set (Recommended)">
    **What to verify**:

    - 10-15 minutes of buffer time between sessions
    - Buffer accounts for your setup/cleanup needs
    - Back-to-back sessions have adequate spacing

    **Why it matters**: Buffer prevents burnout, allows bathroom breaks, and gives you time to prepare between athletes.

    **How to check**: Look at your calendar when multiple sessions are booked—are they too close together?

    **Recommended buffer times**:

    - 1-on-1 sessions: 10-15 minutes
    - Group sessions: 15-20 minutes
    - Complex setups (video, equipment): 20-30 minutes

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Athletes never see buffer time—they just see available slots properly spaced. Buffer is invisible to them but saves your sanity.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Capacity Settings Match Your Intent">
    **What to verify**:

    - Max athletes per session is correct (1 for private, 4-20 for groups)
    - Group size matches your facility/equipment capacity
    - You're comfortable coaching that many athletes simultaneously

    **How to check**: Edit your scheduler and review the "Max Athletes Per Session" setting.

    **Common mistake**: Setting capacity to 10 for a "private" session, then being surprised when 10 athletes book the same slot.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 3: Payment Configuration

Critical verification if you're charging for sessions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Payment Method Is Configured Correctly">
    **What to verify**:

    - Free vs Paid vs Credit-based is set as intended
    - Price/credit cost is correct
    - Payment product is connected (if using direct payment)
    - Credits are issued properly (if using credit-based)

    **Decision framework**:

    | **Use Free When...** | **Use Direct Payment When...** | **Use Credits When...** |
    | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
    | Trial sessions       | Drop-in/one-time bookings      | Ongoing relationships   |
    | Team practices       | New/unproven athletes          | Monthly memberships     |
    | Assessments          | Event registrations            | Session packages        |
    | Makeup sessions      | Testing pricing                | Subscription models     |

    <Tip>
      **First session recommendation**: Start with FREE to learn the system, then add payment once comfortable.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Credit System Is Set Up (If Using Credits)">
    **What to verify**:

    - Credit-issuing product exists (session package or subscription)
    - Credit price is set on scheduler (e.g., 1 credit per session)
    - Test athlete has credits to test booking
    - Credit restrictions are configured (if any)

    **How to check**:

    1. Go to **Payments → Products**
    2. Verify you have a product that issues credits
    3. Manually grant test credits to your test athlete
    4. Attempt a test booking with credits

    <Note>
      **Credit setup is complex**: If using credits for your first session, expect to spend extra time learning the credit system. Consider starting with free or direct payment first.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Pricing Makes Sense">
    **What to verify**:

    - Price matches your market and experience level
    - Price is competitive with local coaches
    - You're comfortable charging this rate
    - Group pricing reflects per-athlete value vs 1-on-1

    **Pricing reality check questions**:

    - Would _you_ pay this price for this session?
    - Is this sustainable for your business?
    - Does this match or beat your previous hourly rate?
    - For groups: Is the per-athlete price compelling?

    **Common pricing mistakes**:

    - Underpricing to attract athletes (hurts perceived value)
    - Overpricing without proven results (discourages bookings)
    - Same price for 1-on-1 and group sessions (should differ)
    - Forgetting to account for your time, travel, equipment costs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 4: Booking Experience Testing

The most critical phase—see what athletes see and experience.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Booking Link Works">
    **What to verify**:

    - Booking link opens correctly
    - Page loads without errors
    - Session information displays properly
    - Available times are showing

    **How to check**:

    1. Copy your scheduler's booking link
    2. Open in a new browser tab (or incognito/private window)
    3. Verify everything displays as expected

    <Warning>
      **Critical**: If no available times show, your availability isn't configured correctly. Go back and verify your availability settings.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Athlete View Is Clear & Professional">
    **What to verify**:

    - Session name and description are compelling
    - Price or credit cost is clear
    - Duration is obvious
    - No confusing or technical jargon
    - Mobile-friendly display

    **What athletes should immediately understand**:

    1. What they're booking (session type)
    2. How long it lasts (duration)
    3. What it costs (price or credits)
    4. What they'll get out of it (value)

    **How to check**: Show your booking link to someone unfamiliar with your business—can they understand what they're booking within 5 seconds?

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip**: Test on mobile! Many athletes will book from their phones. Your booking experience must work perfectly on small screens.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Test Booking Completes Successfully">
    **What to verify**:

    - Can select an available time slot
    - Can complete the booking process
    - Receive booking confirmation (email/notification)
    - Booking appears on your calendar correctly
    - Test athlete receives confirmation

    **How to test**:

    1. As your test athlete, book a session
    2. Complete the full booking flow
    3. Verify confirmation notifications
    4. Check your calendar for the booking
    5. Verify all information is correct (time, athlete name, session type)

    **If payment required**:

    - Payment processes successfully
    - Amount charged is correct
    - Receipt is generated
    - Funds appear in your account (or marked as pending)

    **If credits required**:

    - Credits are deducted properly
    - Credit balance updates correctly

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Cancellation Flow Works (If Enabled)">
    **What to verify**:

    - Athletes can cancel (if you allow it)
    - Cancellation policy is clear
    - Credits refund properly (if applicable)
    - Cancellation notifications are sent
    - Calendar updates after cancellation

    **How to test**: After creating a test booking, cancel it and verify the process works smoothly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 5: Calendar & Management

Ensure you can effectively manage bookings once they start coming in.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Calendar Is Accurate & Readable">
    **What to verify**:

    - Bookings display correctly in calendar
    - Day/Week/Month views all work
    - Session information is complete
    - Athlete names are visible
    - Times are correct (timezone check)

    **How to check**: Navigate to **Schedule → Calendar** and verify your test booking appears correctly in all views.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ You Can Manually Book Athletes">
    **What to verify**:

    - Can access booking builder
    - Can select athletes, sessions, and times
    - Manual bookings appear on calendar
    - Notifications are sent to athletes

    **Why it matters**: Even with self-service booking, you'll occasionally need to manually book athletes for makeups, special requests, or VIP clients.

    **How to check**:

    1. Go to **Schedule → Calendar**
    2. Click **Book Session**
    3. Walk through the manual booking process
    4. Verify the booking appears correctly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Notifications Are Working">
    **What to verify**:

    - Booking confirmations sent to athletes
    - Booking notifications sent to you
    - Reminder notifications configured (if desired)
    - Cancellation notifications work

    **How to check**: After your test booking, verify both you and the test athlete received notifications.

    <Note>
      **Reminder setup**: If you want automated reminders (1 day before, 1 hour before, etc.), configure these in your scheduler settings under "Reminders."
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 6: Sharing & Distribution

Make your booking link accessible to athletes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Sharing Strategy Is Ready">
    **What to verify**:

    - Booking link is saved and accessible
    - Know where you'll share the link (social media, website, SMS)
    - Have a system for ongoing distribution
    - Considered embedding on website (if applicable)

    **Sharing checklist**:

    - Booking link saved in notes/document
    - Added to email signature
    - Posted on social media profiles
    - Sent to current athlete roster
    - Added to website (if you have one)
    - Shared in messaging apps (WhatsApp, Discord, etc.)

    <Tip>
      **URL shortener tip**: If your booking link is long, use a URL shortener (bit.ly, tinyurl) to create a cleaner link like "bit.ly/CoachMikeBooking"
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="✅ Website Integration (If Applicable)">
    **What to verify**:

    - Scheduler embedded on your CoachIQ website
    - Booking section appears correctly
    - Athletes can book without leaving your site
    - Website is published and live

    **How to check**: Visit your website and test the embedded booking experience.

    **If not using CoachIQ website**: You can still share direct booking links via social media, email, SMS, or embed on external websites using an iframe.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Setup Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. No Availability Set

**Symptom**: Booking link shows "No available times"

**Fix**: Edit your scheduler and add availability (days/times you coach)

### 2. Availability Too Far in Past/Future

**Symptom**: No slots showing even though availability exists

**Fix**: Check your scheduler's date range—ensure it includes today and extends into future

### 3. Minimum Notice Too High

**Symptom**: Athletes complain they can't book

**Fix**: If you set "24-hour minimum notice," athletes can't book sessions within 24 hours. Reduce or remove this restriction.

### 4. Wrong Timezone

**Symptom**: Sessions booked at weird times, athletes/coaches confused

**Fix**: Verify timezone in Settings → Account Settings matches your actual location

### 5. Payment Not Configured

**Symptom**: Athletes can't complete booking

**Fix**: If requiring payment, ensure payment processor is connected and products are set up

### 6. Buffer Time Too Long

**Symptom**: Very few available slots showing

**Fix**: 60+ minutes of buffer time dramatically reduces available slots. Keep buffer to 10-20 minutes.

### 7. Capacity Set Incorrectly

**Symptom**: Multiple athletes booking same "private" session slot

**Fix**: Verify "Max Athletes Per Session" is set to 1 for private sessions

### 8. Credits Not Issued

**Symptom**: Athletes with credit-based sessions can't book

**Fix**: Ensure test athletes have credits granted, or credit-issuing products are set up

## What to monitor after launch

After sharing your booking link, keep an eye on these for the first week:

**Daily checks**:

- Are bookings coming through?
