## Subscriptions vs packages: Understanding the difference

Before diving into subscription setup, understand how subscriptions differ from one-time credit packages.

### Core differences

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Credit Packages">
    **Payment structure**: Single payment upfront

    **Credit issuance**: All credits issued immediately upon purchase

    **Credit behavior**:

    - Finite quantity (e.g., 10 credits)
    - Do not renew automatically
    - Athlete must manually purchase again when depleted

    **Revenue pattern**: Sporadic (depends on when athletes buy)

    **Example**:

    ```
    Product: "10-Credit Training Package"
    Price: $450 (one-time payment)
    Credits issued: 10 (all at once)
    Renewal: None (must repurchase)
    Expiration: 90 days (if configured)
    ```

    **Best for**:

    - New athletes testing your services
    - Athletes who prefer flexibility
    - Drop-in/casual training relationships
    - Gift purchases
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subscription Credit Products">
    **Payment structure**: Recurring billing (monthly/weekly/yearly)

    **Credit issuance**: Credits issued each billing cycle

    **Credit behavior**:

    - Can be finite (e.g., 12 credits/month) OR unlimited (∞)
    - Renews automatically each cycle
    - Active only while subscription active on Stripe

    **Revenue pattern**: Predictable recurring revenue (MRR)

    **Example**:

    ```
    Product: "Monthly Unlimited Training"
    Price: $400/month (recurring)
    Credits issued: Unlimited (∞) per month
    Renewal: Automatic monthly via Stripe
    Expiration: Credits reset each month (not expire, but renew)
    ```

    **Best for**:

    - Committed long-term athletes
    - Predictable business revenue
    - Athletes training 2+ times per week
    - Premium membership offerings
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Why subscriptions transform your business

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Predictable Revenue (MRR)" icon="chart-line">
    **One-time packages**: Sporadic \$450 payments

    **Subscriptions**: Recurring 400/month =  4,800/year per athlete

    **Compounding effect**:

    - Month 1: 10 subscribers = \$4,000 MRR
    - Month 6: 25 subscribers = \$10,000 MRR (with growth + retention)
    - Month 12: 50 subscribers = \$20,000 MRR

    **Business planning**: Predictable revenue enables hiring, facility expansion, equipment investments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Higher Lifetime Value (LTV)" icon="coins">
    **Package athlete**:

    - Buys 10-pack for \$450
    - Uses 8 credits, stops
    - LTV: \$450

    **Subscription athlete**:

    - Subscribes at \$400/month
    - Stays 8 months average
    - LTV: \$3,200 (7x higher!)

    **Why**: Recurring billing = passive renewal (friction-free)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Better Athlete Retention" icon="heart">
    **Package psychology**: "I have 2 credits left, then I'm done"

    **Subscription psychology**: "I pay monthly, might as well use it"

    **Data shows**:

    - Package athletes: 50-60% repurchase rate
    - Subscription athletes: 80-90% renewal rate (when managed well)

    **Reason**: Subscription = ongoing commitment mindset
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reduced Admin Burden" icon="clock">
    **Package model**:

    - Athletes run out of credits
    - You chase renewals
    - Manual sales conversations
    - Inconsistent cash flow

    **Subscription model**:

    - Automatic billing via Stripe
    - Credits renew automatically
    - Athletes self-renew (passive)
    - Consistent cash flow

    **Time saved**: 10-15 hours/month not chasing renewals
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding unlimited credits (∞ notation)

The infinity symbol (∞) in CoachIQ has a specific meaning that's critical to understand.

### What ∞ really means

<Warning>
  **Critical clarification**: ∞ does NOT mean unlimited forever. It means unlimited WITHIN the current billing cycle.
</Warning>

**Accurate interpretation**:

- **∞** = Unlimited credits this month/week/year (depending on subscription frequency)
- **At renewal**: Credits reset to ∞ for the new cycle
- **If subscription ends**: ∞ becomes 0 (credits disappear)

**Example timeline**:

```
Jan 15: Athlete subscribes to "Unlimited Monthly" 
Credits: ∞ (can book unlimited sessions until Feb 15)

Jan 16-Feb 14: Athlete books 12 sessions
Credits still show: ∞ (not decreasing)

Feb 15: Subscription renews, payment processes
Credits: ∞ (reset for February cycle)

Feb 16-Mar 14: Athlete books 10 sessions  
Credits: ∞ (unlimited continues)

Mar 15: Subscription payment FAILS (expired card)
Subscription becomes inactive on Stripe
Credits: 0 (unlimited credits now unusable)
```

### Credit  display variations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="∞ with Usage Tracking (Subscription Credits)">
    **Display**: Under "Redeemable Schedulers" section

    ```
    Rising Stars Class (3/∞)
    Rising Stars Shooting Lab (0/∞)
    Rising Stars Open Gym (5/∞)
    ```

    **Meaning**:

    - Athlete has unlimited credits for these schedulers this cycle
    - Numbers show: (Credits used this cycle / Unlimited remaining)
    - **3/∞** = Used 3 times this cycle, unlimited still available

    **Resets**: At subscription renewal, all counters reset to 0/∞

    **Why track usage if unlimited?**:

    1. Coach monitoring (which sessions most popular?)
    2. Usage limit enforcement (if "max 3/week" limit exists)
    3. Athlete self-awareness (used 15 times this month—great engagement!)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Finite Credits That Display Differently">
    **Not ∞ but similar concept**:

    Some subscriptions issue finite credits monthly:

    ```
    Monthly 12-Credit Membership
    Credit Balance: 12 (not ∞)
    Renewal: Gets 12 fresh credits each month
    ```

    **Difference from ∞**:

    - Athlete sees decreasing count (12 → 11 → 10...)
    - When depleted to 0, must wait for renewal
    - ∞ never shows decreasing count

    **Same as ∞**:

    - Resets at renewal
    - Active only while subscription live
    - Tied to billing cycle
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating a subscription product

Step-by-step: Setting up recurring credit memberships.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to product creation">
    Dashboard → **Payments** → **Products** → Click **\+ Create**

    You'll see product type options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select subscription type">
    **Choose**: "Subscription"

    **NOT**: "One-Time" (that's for credit packages)

    <Frame>
      ![Selecting subscription product type](/select-sub-ui.png)
    </Frame>
    <Note>
      **Important**: This choice defines whether billing is recurring. Cannot change after creation—if you pick wrong type, must delete and recreate product.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure basic product info">
    **Required fields**:

    **Product name**: Clear, descriptive name

    - ✅ "Unlimited Monthly Training Membership"
    - ✅ "3x/Week Youth Program Subscription"
    - ❌ "Training" (too vague)
    - ❌ "Option 1" (meaningless to athletes)

    **Price**: Recurring amount (e.g., \$400)

    **Billing frequency**: How often to charge

    - **Monthly** (most common)
    - **Weekly** (less common, for frequent trainers)
    - **Yearly** (annual pre-pay, large discount)
    - **Custom** (every 2 weeks, quarterly, etc.)

    **Description**: Explain what subscription includes

    ```
    Example: "Train unlimited times per month at our group classes. 
    Includes access to all Rising Stars schedulers. Book up to 4 
    sessions per week. Cancel anytime with 30-day notice."
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Pricing psychology**: 399 feels significantly cheaper than 400. Use X97 or X99 pricing for better conversion.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure credit issuance">
    Scroll to **Credits** section

    **Decision point**: Unlimited (∞) OR finite credits per cycle?

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Unlimited Credits (∞)">
        **Setting**: Enable "Unlimited Credits" toggle or checkbox

        **Result**: Athlete gets ∞ credits each billing cycle

        **Use when**:

        - Offering "all-you-can-train" membership
        - Want maximum simplicity (no credit counting)
        - Trust athletes not to abuse (or have usage limits configured)

        **Example configuration**:

        ```
        Monthly Unlimited Membership - $400/month
        Credits: Unlimited (∞)
        Redeemable schedulers: All group classes
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Finite Credits Per Cycle">
        **Setting**: Enter number (e.g., "12 credits")

        **Result**: Athlete gets 12 fresh credits each billing cycle

        **Use when**:

        - Want defined usage expectations (12 = 3x/week)
        - More comfortable with finite limits
        - Easier to understand for athletes ("12 sessions/month")

        **Example configuration**:

        ```
        Monthly 12-Credit Membership - $350/month
        Credits: 12 per month
        Expiration: Unused credits expire at renewal
        Redeemable schedulers: All sessions
        ```

        <Note>
          **Expiration option**: Unused credits can either:

          1. **Expire** (athlete loses them at renewal)
          2. **Carry over** (athlete accumulates unused credits)

          Most subscriptions use **expire** to prevent credit hoarding.
        </Note>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set credit restrictions">
    **Redeemable Schedulers** section: Select which schedulers accept these credits

    **Example restriction strategy**:

    ```
    Basic Subscription ($250/month):
      ✓ Group Classes only
    
    Standard Subscription ($400/month):
      ✓ Group Classes
      ✓ Open Gym
      ✓ Clinics
    
    Premium Subscription ($600/month):
      ✓ All of the above
      ✓ Semi-Private Sessions (normally $75 each)
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Product tiering**: Use scheduler restrictions to differentiate subscription levels (Basic \< Standard \< Premium)
    </Tip>
    For detailed scheduler restriction setup, see [Article #26: Credit Usage Limits](/scheduling/credit-usage-limits).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure usage limits (optional but recommended)">
    **Usage Limits** section: Set daily/weekly/monthly booking caps

    **For unlimited (∞) subscriptions**:

    - **Recommended**: Weekly limit (e.g., "4 bookings per week")
    - **Prevents abuse**: Athlete can't book 30 sessions in Week 1
    - **Encourages consistency**: Spreads usage across month

    **For finite credit subscriptions**:

    - Often unnecessary (credit count is the limit)
    - Consider if: Enforcing program structure (e.g., max 2/week for 8-week program)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set renewal and cancellation policy">
    **Renewal settings**:

    - **Auto-renew**: Enabled by default (this is how subscriptions work)
    - **Trial period**: Optional first-month discount or free trial
    - **Renewal reminder**: Auto-email 3 days before renewal (if available)

    **Cancellation policy**:

    ```
    Example policy:
    "Cancel anytime. Cancellations take effect at end of current 
    billing period (you keep access until paid-for period ends). 
    No refunds for partial months."
    ```

    **Important**: Document policy in:

    - Product description
    - Website terms of service
    - Confirmation email after purchase
    - Athlete portal

    <Warning>
      **Legal requirement**: Clear cancellation terms required in most jurisdictions. Work with attorney if unsure.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and activate">
    Click  **Create Subscription**

    **Verification checklist**:

    - ✅ Product appears in Payments → Products list
    - ✅ Product type shows "Subscription"
    - ✅ Price displays as "\$/month" (or chosen frequency)
    - ✅ Credit configuration correct (∞ or finite number)
    - ✅ Redeemable schedulers listed
    - ✅ Usage limits configured (if applicable)

    **Test**:

    1. Assign product to test athlete account
    2. Process test payment via Stripe
    3. Verify credits appear in athlete profile
    4. Test booking with subscription credits
    5. Verify Stripe shows active subscription

    <Check>
      **Success!** Your subscription product is live and ready for athletes to purchase.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Subscription credit renewal behavior

Understanding how credits refresh each billing cycle.

### How automatic renewal works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subscription renewal date arrives">
    **Example**: Athlete subscribed Jan 15, monthly frequency

    **Renewal date**: Feb 15 (one month later)

    **What happens**:

    1. Stripe attempts to charge athlete's saved payment method
    2. If payment succeeds: Subscription stays active
    3. If payment fails: Subscription becomes inactive (more on this below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credits reset (if payment succeeds)">
    **For unlimited (∞) subscriptions**:

    - Credit balance: Still shows ∞
    - Usage tracking: Resets to 0/∞ for all schedulers

    **For finite credit subscriptions**:

    - Credit balance: Resets to original amount (e.g., 12)
    - Unused credits: Expire OR carry over (per configuration)
    - Usage limits: Reset to 0

    **Athlete sees**: Fresh credits available, can book again

    <Note>
      **Seamless transition**: Athletes typically don't notice renewal if payment auto-succeeds. Credits just "keep working."
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credit logs update">
    New entry in athlete's credit logs:

    ```
    Feb 15, 9:00 AM | +∞ Credits | Subscription Renewed - Monthly Unlimited Membership
    ```

    Or for finite:

    ```
    Feb 15, 9:00 AM | +12 Credits | Subscription Renewed - Monthly 12-Credit Membership
    ```

    **Purpose**: Tracks renewal history, helps with dispute resolution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stripe subscription status">
    In your Stripe dashboard:

    **Status**: "Active" **Current period**: Feb 15 - Mar 14 **Next billing date**: Mar 15 **Total charged to date**: Updated

    **Athlete's payment history**: Shows successful renewal charge
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Unused credit behavior at renewal

**Critical decision**: What happens to unused credits when subscription renews?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Expire at Renewal (Recommended)">
    **Configuration**: "Unused credits expire at renewal"

    **What happens**:

    - Athlete had 12 credits, used 8, has 4 remaining
    - At renewal: Remaining 4 credits disappear
    - Athlete gets fresh 12 credits

    **Pros**:

    - ✅ Prevents credit hoarding (athletes can't accumulate hundreds of unused credits)
    - ✅ Encourages consistent usage ("use it or lose it")
    - ✅ Predictable liability for coach (max 12 credits/athlete outstanding)
    - ✅ Aligns with "monthly membership" concept

    **Cons**:

    - ❌ Athlete loses value if they don't use all credits
    - ❌ Can feel punitive (especially if illness/vacation caused underuse)

    **Best for**: Most subscription models, especially unlimited or high-credit counts
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Carry Over (Accumulate)">
    **Configuration**: "Unused credits carry over to next billing cycle"

    **What happens**:

    - Athlete had 12 credits, used 8, has 4 remaining
    - At renewal: Athlete keeps 4 + gets fresh 12 = 16 total
    - Next month: If uses 10, has 6 remaining + gets 12 more = 18 total

    **Pros**:

    - ✅ Athlete-friendly (no lost value)
    - ✅ Flexibility for irregular training schedules
    - ✅ Rewards loyal subscribers (long-term athletes accumulate buffer)

    **Cons**:

    - ❌ Credit liability grows over time (athlete might accumulate 50+ credits)
    - ❌ Athlete might cancel after accumulating credits, use them all, then leave
    - ❌ Undermines monthly structure (athlete could go 3 months without training, use 36 credits in Month 4)

    **Best for**: Low-frequency subscriptions (e.g., 4 credits/month) or premium client relationships

    <Warning>
      **Financial risk**: Carry-over can create large outstanding credit liability. Monitor carefully. (Not recommended)
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing subscription lifecycles

What happens at each stage of a subscription's life.

### Active subscription stage

**Status**: Subscription active on Stripe, payments processing successfully

**Athlete experience**:

- Credits available (∞ or finite amount showing)
- Can book sessions using subscription credits
- Automatic renewals happening seamlessly

**Coach actions**:

- Monitor usage (are athletes actually using subscriptions?)
- Engagement outreach if low usage (prevent voluntary cancellation)
- Upsell opportunities if high usage (upgrade to premium tier)

**Health metrics to track**:

- **Usage rate**: What % of credits/bookings are athletes using?
  - Healthy: 70-90% usage
  - Concerning: 50% usage (risk of cancellation)
  - Over: \>95% usage (opportunity to upsell)
- **Payment success rate**: What % of renewals process successfully?
  - Healthy: \>90% success rate
  - Concerning: 85% success rate (many failed payments)

---

### Payment failure (Involuntary churn)

**What triggers it**: Athlete's payment method fails at renewal (expired card, insufficient funds)

**What happens automatically**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stripe attempts charge">
    Renewal date arrives, Stripe tries to charge saved payment method

    **Result**: Payment declined/failed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stripe retry logic">
    Stripe automatically retries failed payments on schedule:

    - Smart retries over 2-3 weeks
    - Varies by Stripe settings (customize in Stripe dashboard)

    **Athlete notified**: Stripe sends email "Your payment failed, please update"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription status changes">
    After retries exhausted with no successful payment:

    **Stripe status**: Changes from "Active" to "Incomplete" or "Past Due"

    **CoachIQ impact**:

    - Subscription becomes inactive in CoachIQ
    - Credits become unusable (even if balance shows ∞ or number)
    - Athlete CANNOT book using these credits
    - Athlete CAN still log in, CAN still book using Master Credits or direct payment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Athlete sees error">
    When trying to book with subscription credits:

    **Message**: "Subscription inactive. Update payment method to continue."

    Or similar error indicating payment issue

    **Solution required**: Athlete must update payment method in Athlete Portal or Stripe
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Coach actions when payment fails**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Week 1: Personal outreach">
    **Day 7-10 after failure**: If still not resolved, send personal message

    **Example message**:

    ```
    "Hey [Name], I noticed your membership payment didn't go through 
    this month. Just wanted to reach out personally—your subscription 
    is currently on hold. 
    
    You can update your payment method here: [link to Athlete Portal]
    
    Let me know if you need any help, or if you'd like to discuss 
    your membership. I want to make sure you can keep training with us!"
    ```

    **Tone**: Helpful, not accusatory (athletes appreciate personal touch)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week 2: Offer alternative">
    **Day 14-21 after failure**: If still unresolved, offer options

    **Example message**:

    ```
    "Hi [Name], I haven't heard back about your membership payment. 
    I want to help you continue training! Here are some options:
    
    1. Update payment method: [link]
    2. Switch to pay-per-session temporarily (no commitment)
    3. Pause membership for 30 days (keeps your rate when you return)
    4. Or if you need to cancel, I understand—just let me know
    
    What works best for you?"
    ```

    **Goal**: Understand if this is:

    - Temporary issue (expired card) → Help resolve
    - Financial hardship → Offer payment plan or pause
    - Voluntary cancellation → Exit gracefully
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week 3: Final notice">
    **Day 21-30 after failure**: Last attempt before cancellation

    **Example message**:

    ```
    "[Name], your membership has been on hold for 3 weeks due to 
    payment issue. I'll need to cancel the subscription by [date] 
    if we can't resolve this.
    
    I'd hate to see you go! If you want to continue, please update 
    your payment method ASAP: [link]
    
    Otherwise, let's connect to discuss next steps."
    ```

    **After 30 days**: Cancel subscription in Stripe (releases athlete from failed payment attempts)

    **Document**: Note in athlete profile why subscription ended (involuntary churn due to payment failure)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Voluntary cancellation (Athlete initiated)

**What triggers it**: Athlete cancels subscription themselves

**How athletes cancel**:

1. Athlete Portal → Settings → Billing → Subscriptions → Cancel
2. Or: Contact you requesting cancellation
3. Or: Dispute charge with credit card company (worst case)

**Effect**:

- Subscription status: "Active (cancels [date])" in Stripe
- Credits: Remain usable until period ends
- Access: Maintained through paid period
- Refund: None (athlete received full month value)

**Example**:

- Athlete subscribed Jan 15 (monthly)
- Cancels Feb 3
- Status: Active until Feb 14 (original renewal date)
- Feb 15: Subscription becomes "Canceled," credits disappear

**Athlete experience**: "Your cancellation will take effect on [date]. You have access until then."

**Pros**: Fair to athlete (gets full paid period), reduces refund disputes, clean accounting

**Cons**: Athlete has several days/weeks to change mind and reactivate (good or bad depending on perspective)

<Check>
  **Best practice**: End-of-period cancellation is industry standard and most fair to athletes.
</Check>

**Coach response to cancellation**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Acknowledge promptly">
    Send confirmation within 24 hours:

    ```
    "Hi [Name], I've received your cancellation request. Your 
    subscription will remain active through [end date], and you 
    can continue training until then.
    
    I'm sorry to see you go! If you're open to it, I'd love to 
    hear what led to this decision. Your feedback helps me improve.
    
    Thanks for training with me, and the door is always open if 
    you want to return in the future!"
    ```

    **Tone**: Gracious, non-defensive, door open for return
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request feedback (optional survey)">
    **Option 1: Simple question**

    - "What was the main reason for canceling?" (open-ended)

    **Option 2: Multiple choice**

    - Financial reasons
    - Moving/relocating
    - Schedule doesn't fit anymore
    - Not seeing results I wanted
    - Prefer different training style
    - Other (please specify)

    **Use feedback**: Identify patterns, improve offerings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer win-back opportunity">
    If cancellation reason is resolvable:

    **Financial**: "Would a lower-tier membership work better for your budget?"

    **Scheduling**: "We just added morning sessions—would those fit better?"

    **Results**: "I'd love to discuss your goals—let's optimize your training plan"

    **Don't pressure**: One offer, then respect decision
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document and tag">
    **In athlete profile**:

    - Tag: "Former Subscriber"
    - Note: Cancellation date and reason
    - Flag: "Win-back candidate" (if reason was resolvable)

    **Use later**: Targeted re-engagement campaigns (e.g., "We miss you!" email 3 months later)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can athlete have multiple subscriptions at once?">
    **Short answer**: Technically yes, but generally not recommended

    **How it works**:

    - Athlete purchases "Basic Subscription" (\$250/month)
    - Later purchases "Premium Subscription" (\$600/month)
    - Now paying \$850/month total for both

    **Platform behavior**: Athlete has 2 separate credit tabs, 2 separate subscriptions in Stripe

    **Why avoid**:

    - Confusing for athlete (which credits to use?)
    - Double billing (athlete likely didn't intend this)
    - Billing management nightmare

    **Better solution**:

    1. Cancel old subscription
    2. Switch to new subscription
    3. Single active subscription at a time

    **Exception**: Athlete wants base subscription + add-on

    - "Unlimited Classes" (400/month) + "Private Session Add-On" (150/month for 2 private sessions)
    - This is intentional stacking, clearly communicated
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if athlete wants to downgrade subscription?">
    **Scenario**: Athlete on Premium (600/month) wants to switch to Basic (250/month)

    **Process**:

    1. **Athlete requests downgrade**: Via message, email, or portal
    2. **Confirm timing**:
       - Immediate: Lose premium benefits immediately, get partial refund (if you offer)
       - End of period: Keep premium through paid period, then downgrade (recommended)
    3. **Cancel current subscription**: In Stripe, cancel Premium subscription
    4. **Enroll in new tier**: Add Basic subscription to athlete profile
    5. **Process pricing difference** (if mid-period):
       - Pro-rate: Refund unused portion of Premium, charge for Basic
       - Or: Wait until current Premium period ends, then start Basic (recommended)

    **Communication**:

    ```
    "I've switched you to the Basic Membership starting [date]. 
    You'll be charged $250/month going forward (saves you $350/month!).
    
    Your access will change to Basic tier features as of [date].
    
    You can always upgrade back to Premium anytime!"
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Make it easy**: Frictionless downgrades = lower churn. Athlete who downgrades is still a paying subscriber (vs full cancellation).

  <Accordion title="Should I offer refunds on subscriptions?">
    **Legal landscape**: Varies by jurisdiction

    **General guidelines**:

    **Pro-rated refunds**:

    - Not typically required if athlete has access through paid period
    - Example: Athlete pays \$400 for February, cancels Feb 10, has access through Feb 28 = no refund owed

    **When refunds make sense**:

    - Service issue (your fault): Full refund appropriate
    - Payment processing error: Issue refund + fix
    - Athlete charged accidentally (didn't mean to subscribe): Refund within 24-48 hours

    **When refunds DON'T make sense**:

    - Athlete simply changed mind after using service
    - "I didn't train this month" (athlete's choice, not your fault)
    - Buyer's remorse after 7+ days

    **Your refund policy** (example):

    ```
    "Subscription refunds available within 48 hours of first charge 
    if no credits used. After 48 hours or if credits used, no 
    refunds—cancel anytime to stop future charges."
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Document clearly**: Refund policy must be visible at purchase, in terms of service, and in confirmation email.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change subscription price for existing subscribers?">
    **Short answer**: Yes, but handle carefully

    **Process**:

    **1. Grandfather vs Universal Change**:

    - **Grandfather**: Keep existing subscribers at old price, new subscribers pay new price
    - **Universal**: All subscribers pay new price after X date

    **2. Communicate in advance** (30-60 days notice):

    ```
    "Heads up: Starting March 1, the Monthly Unlimited Membership 
    will increase from $400 to $450/month due to rising costs.
    
    As a current member, you have 2 options:
    1. Lock in current $400 rate by switching to annual pre-pay ($4,800/year)
    2. Continue monthly at new $450 rate starting March 1
    
    You're a valued member—I wanted to give you advance notice and options. 
    Questions? Reply anytime!"
    ```

    **3. Update Stripe**:

    - Stripe → Products → [Subscription] → Edit pricing
    - Set effective date for new price
    - Existing subscriptions: Update via Stripe dashboard

    **Best practice**: Grandfather existing subscribers for 6-12 months (goodwill gesture), then migrate all to new price
