Mark athletes as checked in when they arrive for sessions. Check-in data is timestamped and saved to each booking, giving you a clear attendance record.

**Where to find this**: Schedule → Calendar → Click any booking

## Check in from the calendar

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click a booking on the calendar">
    Open your calendar and click on any scheduled session. The booking details modal appears showing all participants.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the checkmark next to each athlete">
    Each participant has a circle next to their name. Click it to mark them as checked in.

    - **Gray circle** = Not checked in
    - **Green checkmark** = Checked in

    The header updates to show how many athletes are checked in (e.g., "6/10 Participants - 3 Checked In").
