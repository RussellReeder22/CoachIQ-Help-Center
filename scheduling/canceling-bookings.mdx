## How to cancel a booking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the booking">
    **Two ways to access:**

    1. **From Calendar**: Schedule → Calendar → Click the booking
    2. **From Athlete Profile**: People → Clients → Select athlete → Upcoming Bookings

    Choose whichever is most convenient.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open booking details">
    Click on the specific booking to open the details panel.

    You'll see:

    - Athlete name
    - Session time/date
    - Scheduler type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Cancel'">
    Look for the **Cancel** button (usually red or in actions menu).

    Click it to initiate cancellation.

    <Note>
      Note: Before cancelling be sure to notify your clients of cancellation and your reason. Look for the Send Message to All button to message all participants in a session. 
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm cancellation">
    System asks for confirmation to prevent accidental cancellations.

    Note: If a client booked with a credit the system will prompt you to refund the credit to their account or not.

    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    **Cancel** to complete the cancellation.

    <Check>
      **Booking canceled!** Session removed from calendar, athlete notified, credits handled per policy.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Bulk cancellation**: To cancel multiple sessions at once (like an entire week), cancel each individually from the calendar. There's no bulk cancel currently—filter your calendar to the specific date range to speed this up.
</Tip>

    - Offer priority rebooking
    - Consider offering extra session or discount for inconvenience

</Tabs>

### Setting your policy

**Where to configure**:

**Communicate clearly**:
