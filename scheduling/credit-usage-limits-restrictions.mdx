## Understanding credit usage limits

Credit usage limits give you control over **how** and **where** athletes can redeem their credits. Without limits, athletes could potentially abuse unlimited subscriptions or use credits in ways that harm your business model.

### Why limits matter

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Business Protection">
    **Scenarios limits prevent:**

    ❌ Athlete with unlimited monthly credits books 30 sessions in one day\
    ❌ Athlete shares unlimited subscription with friends who book under their account\
    ❌ Athlete uses premium package credits for basic sessions (margin erosion)\
    ❌ Athlete books all high-demand time slots, blocking other paying athletes\
    ❌ Family shares one subscription across multiple people

    **Result without limits**: Revenue loss, capacity problems, unfair access distribution

    **Result with limits**: Predictable usage, fair access, protected margins
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Athlete Fairness">
    **Limits create fairness:**

    ✅ Prevents one athlete from monopolizing popular time slots\
    ✅ Ensures all subscription holders get equitable access\
    ✅ Maintains capacity for new athlete acquisition

    **Example**: Monthly unlimited subscription with "3 bookings per week" limit ensures athletes train consistently rather than booking 12 sessions in Week 1 and none in Weeks 2-4.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Business Model Alignment">
    **Limits align pricing with value:**

    ✅ Premium schedulers can require more credits (2 credits for advanced training)\
    ✅ Restrict basic package credits to basic schedulers only\
    ✅ Force high-value sessions to require premium subscriptions\
    ✅ Create clear product tiers with different access levels\
    ✅ Protect high-margin offerings

    **Example**: "$200/month Youth Program" credits only work for youth schedulers, not your $75/session private training.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Types of credit restrictions

CoachIQ offers multiple restriction mechanisms. Understanding each type helps you build the right control structure.

### Scheduler-specific restrictions

**What it does**: Limits which schedulers accept credits from a specific product/subscription

**How it works**: When creating a product, you select which schedulers can redeem these credits. Athletes can ONLY use these credits for designated schedulers.

**Example configuration:**

```
Product: "Rising Stars Youth Membership - $250/month"
Credits Issued: Unlimited (∞)
Redeemable Schedulers:
  ✓ Rising Stars Class
  ✓ Rising Stars Shooting Lab
  ✓ Rising Stars Open Gym
  ✗ Elite Training (not included)
  ✗ Private Sessions (not included)
```

**Athlete experience**: When booking "Elite Training," these credits won't show as payment option. They'll need Master Credits or direct payment.

<Tip>
  **Best practice**: Scheduler-specific restrictions are your FIRST line of defense. Always configure these when creating products.
</Tip>

### Usage frequency limits

**What it does**: Controls how many times per day/week/month athletes can book using credits

**Common configurations:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Booking Limit">
    **Example**: "Maximum 1 booking per day"

    **Use case**: Prevent athletes from booking multiple sessions same day

    **Business reason**:

    - Ensures recovery time between sessions
    - Prevents capacity hoarding
    - Spreads demand across days

    **Athlete sees**: "You've reached your daily booking limit for this subscription"

    **Reset**: Midnight each day (coach's timezone)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly Booking Limit">
    **Example**: "Maximum 3 bookings per week"

    **Use case**: Control subscription usage to match pricing model

    **Business reason**:

    - "3x/week membership" = max 12 sessions/month at 3/week
    - Prevents binge booking (using all month's value in Week 1)
    - Predictable capacity planning

    **Athlete sees**: "You've used 3 of 3 weekly bookings for this subscription. Resets on Monday."

    **Reset**: Every Monday (or first day of athlete's subscription cycle)

    <Note>
      **Pro tip**: Weekly limits are most effective for unlimited subscriptions to prevent abuse while maintaining flexibility.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monthly Booking Limit">
    **Example**: "Maximum 12 bookings per month"

    **Use case**: Cap unlimited subscriptions to defined usage

    **Business reason**:

    - Unlimited subscriptions need reasonable maximums
    - "12 bookings/month" = 3x/week average (sustainable)
    - Protects against extreme overuse

    **Athlete sees**: "You've used 12 of 12 monthly bookings. Resets on [renewal date]."

    **Reset**: Athlete's subscription renewal date (varies per athlete)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Per-Scheduler Limits">
    **Example**: "Maximum 2 bookings per week for Rising Stars Shooting Lab"

    **Use case**: Limit specific high-demand or high-cost schedulers

    **Business reason**:

    - Specialty sessions have higher overhead
    - Prevents athletes from only booking premium sessions
    - Encourages diverse training

    **Athlete sees**: "You've reached your limit for Rising Stars Shooting Lab this week (2/2 used)"

    **Reset**: Per scheduler, according to limit type (daily/weekly/monthly)

    <Tip>
      **Strategic use**: Great for balancing access to premium offerings within broader membership
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Multi-credit sessions

**What it does**: Makes certain schedulers cost MORE than 1 credit per booking

**How it works**: Configure scheduler to require 2, 3, or more credits per booking

**Use cases:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Premium Session Pricing">
    **Configuration**: Private training costs 2 credits, group class costs 1 credit

    **Business logic**:

    - Reflects higher value/cost of private sessions
    - Athlete with 10-credit package gets:
      - 10 group sessions OR
      - 5 private sessions OR
      - Mix (e.g., 6 group + 2 private = 10 credits)

    **Benefit**: Single package serves multiple session types with appropriate pricing

    **Example**:

    ```
    Package: "10-Credit Flex Package - $450"
    Session Types:
      - Group Training: 1 credit ($45 value)
      - Semi-Private (2 people): 1.5 credits ($67.50 value)
      - Private Training: 2 credits ($90 value)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Longer Session Duration">
    **Configuration**: 30-min session = 1 credit, 60-min session = 2 credits

    **Business logic**: Time-proportional pricing

    **Athlete choice**: Pick session length based on credit availability and goals

    **Example**:

    ```
    Scheduler Options:
      - 30-Min Quick Hit: 1 credit
      - 60-Min Full Training: 2 credits
      - 90-Min Extended Session: 3 credits
    ```

    **Flexibility**: Athlete with 5 credits could book 5×30min OR 2×60min + 1×30min
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specialty Services">
    **Configuration**: Standard training = 1 credit, video analysis session = 3 credits

    **Business logic**: Reflects additional coach prep time, technology costs, expertise

    **Use case**:

    - Video analysis requires 30min filming + 60min review + editing
    - Costs you more time/resources than standard session
    - 3 credits = appropriate compensation

    **Athlete perception**: Specialty service is premium offering (higher credit cost signals higher value)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Keep it simple**: Most coaches should stick to 1-2 credit variations max. Complex multi-credit systems confuse athletes and complicate booking.
</Warning>

## Configuring scheduler-specific restrictions

Step-by-step: Limiting credits to specific schedulers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to product builder">
    Dashboard → **Payments** → **Products** → Select product → **Edit**

    Or: Create new product and continue to credit configuration section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll to Credit Limits section">
    You'll see several configuration options:

    - **Add credits once purchased**: Number of credits issued (or ∞ for unlimited)
    - **Credit expiration options**: Carry over vs expire
    - **Redeemable Schedulers**: 🎯 THIS IS WHERE YOU SET RESTRICTIONS

    <Frame>
      ![Credit Limits configuration in product builder](/images/product-credit-limits-section.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Redeemable Schedulers">
    Click **Select Schedulers** or similar button

    **You'll see**:

    - List of all your active schedulers
    - Checkboxes next to each scheduler
    - Search/filter options (if many schedulers)

    **Action**: Check ONLY the schedulers where these credits should work

    <Tip>
      **Strategic thinking**: Leave unchecked = credits won't work there (athlete will need Master Credits or direct payment)
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure scheduler-level details (if available)">
    Some products allow per-scheduler limits:

    **Example**:

    ```
    Rising Stars Membership - Redeemable Schedulers:
      ✓ Rising Stars Class (Unlimited bookings)
      ✓ Rising Stars Shooting Lab (Max 2/week)
      ✓ Rising Stars Open Gym (Max 4/month)
    ```

    **Configuration**: Click scheduler to expand advanced settings

    **Set**: Daily, weekly, or monthly limits per scheduler
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    Click **Save** or **Update Product**

    **Verification checklist**:

    1. Product shows selected schedulers in "Redeemable Schedulers" section
    2. Athlete profile shows these schedulers under product's credit tab
    3. Test booking: Athlete can book selected schedulers, blocked from others

    <Check>
      **Success!** Credits are now restricted to designated schedulers only.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring usage frequency limits

Setting daily, weekly, or monthly booking caps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open product credit limits">
    Dashboard → **Payments** → **Products** → [Product] → **Edit** → **Credit Limits** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Usage Limits configuration">
    Look for section labeled:

    - "Usage Limits"
    - "Booking Frequency"
    - "Credit Usage Restrictions"
    - Or similar naming

    <Note>
      **Platform variation**: Exact naming and location may vary. If you don't see these options, usage limits may be configured at the scheduler level instead of product level.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set frequency limit">
    **Options you might see**:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Daily Limit">
        **Setting**: "Maximum bookings per day: [X]"

        **Example**: Set to "1" for "max 1 booking per day"

        **Effect**: Athlete can book once daily using these credits, resets at midnight

        **Best for**: Preventing same-day multi-booking
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Weekly Limit">
        **Setting**: "Maximum bookings per week: [X]"

        **Example**: Set to "3" for "max 3 bookings per week"

        **Effect**: Athlete can book 3 times weekly using these credits, resets Monday

        **Best for**: Unlimited subscriptions with consistent usage expectations

        <Tip>
          **Recommended for unlimited subscriptions**: Set weekly limit = (monthly expected usage ÷ 4 weeks). Example: 12 sessions/month target = 3/week limit.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Monthly Limit">
        **Setting**: "Maximum bookings per month: [X]"

        **Example**: Set to "12" for "max 12 bookings per month"

        **Effect**: Athlete can book 12 times monthly using these credits, resets on renewal date

        **Best for**: Subscription cap that aligns with billing cycle
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    **Save** product configuration

    **Test scenario**:

    1. Assign product to test athlete
    2. Have them book sessions up to limit
    3. Attempt to book one more
    4. Should see: "You've reached your [daily/weekly/monthly] booking limit for [Product Name]"

    **Verify**: Limit resets at appropriate time (daily, weekly, monthly)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Limit stacking**: If you set BOTH weekly (3 bookings) AND daily (1 booking) limits, the more restrictive limit applies. Athlete can't book 3 times in one day even though weekly limit is 3.
</Warning>

---

## Configuring multi-credit sessions

Making certain schedulers cost multiple credits per booking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to scheduler settings">
    Dashboard → **Schedule** → **Schedulers** → Select scheduler → **Settings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find payment/pricing section">
    Scroll to "Payment Options" or "Pricing" section

    You'll see options for:

    - Free
    - Direct Payment (\$ amount)
    - Credit Redemption ← THIS IS WHERE YOU CONFIGURE

    <Frame>
      ![Scheduler payment configuration](/images/scheduler-payment-options.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set credit cost">
    **Look for**: "Credits required" or "Credit cost" field

    **Configuration options**:

    - **1 credit** (default/standard)
    - **2 credits** (common for premium)
    - **3+ credits** (specialty/extended sessions)
    - **0.5 credits** (half-sessions, if you want to use fractional credits)

    **Select**: Number of credits this scheduler requires per booking

    <Note>
      **Recommendation**: Stick to whole numbers (1, 2, 3) for simplicity. Fractional credits (0.5, 1.5) work but confuse some athletes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure hybrid payment (optional)">
    If you want to offer BOTH credit AND direct payment options:

    **Example**: "2 Credits OR \$90"

    **Configuration**:

    - Credits required: 2
    - Direct payment amount: \$90
    - Enable both options

    **Athlete choice**: At booking, athlete chooses payment method (use 2 credits OR pay \$90)

    <Tip>
      **Strategic pricing**: Price direct payment higher than credit-equivalent to incentivize package purchases.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    **Save** scheduler settings

    **Test**:

    1. Athlete with credits attempts to book
    2. System should deduct 2 credits (or configured amount)
    3. Credit logs should show: "-2 Credits | Redeemed for [Scheduler Name]"
    4. Athlete's balance decreases by 2

    <Check>
      **Success!** Scheduler now costs multiple credits per booking.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding limit interactions

How different limits work together (and sometimes conflict).

### Limit priority hierarchy

When multiple limits exist, this is the order CoachIQ enforces:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Scheduler-specific restrictions (highest priority)">
    **Question**: Can this product's credits even be used for this scheduler?

    **Check**: Is scheduler in product's "Redeemable Schedulers" list?

    **If NO**: Booking blocked entirely (other limits don't matter)

    **If YES**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Credit balance check">
    **Question**: Does athlete have enough credits?

    **Check**: Athlete's credit balance ≥ scheduler's credit cost?

    **If NO**: Booking blocked (athlete needs more credits)

    **If YES**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Usage frequency limits">
    **Question**: Has athlete hit daily/weekly/monthly booking limit?

    **Check**: Current bookings vs limit for this product

    **If limit reached**: Booking blocked (athlete must wait for reset)

    **If under limit**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Scheduler capacity">
    **Question**: Is there room in the session?

    **Check**: Current bookings vs max capacity

    **If full**: Booking blocked (session full)

    **If space available**: ✅ **Booking allowed**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example limit interaction scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Master Credits bypass scheduler restrictions">
    **Setup**:

    - Athlete has "Youth Program" subscription (restricted to youth schedulers only)
    - Athlete also has 2 Master Credits

    **Question**: Can athlete use Master Credits for adult scheduler not in youth subscription?

    **Answer**: YES! Master Credits have no scheduler restrictions

    **System behavior**:

    1. Athlete views adult scheduler
    2. Youth subscription credits NOT shown as payment option (restricted)
    3. Master Credits ARE shown as payment option
    4. Athlete can book using Master Credits

    **Lesson**: Master Credits are ultimate override for scheduler restrictions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Weekly limit + multi-credit session">
    **Setup**:

    - Product: "Unlimited Monthly" with 3 bookings/week limit
    - Scheduler: "Private Training" costs 2 credits/booking

    **Question**: Can athlete book 3 Private Training sessions in one week?

    **Answer**: NO (probably)

    **System behavior**:

    - First booking: Uses 2 credits, counts as 1 booking toward weekly limit (1/3)
    - Second booking: Uses 2 credits, counts as 1 booking toward weekly limit (2/3)
    - Third booking: Uses 2 credits, counts as 1 booking toward weekly limit (3/3)
    - Fourth attempt: BLOCKED (weekly limit reached, even though credits still unlimited)

    **Lesson**: Usage limits count BOOKINGS, not credits consumed

    <Note>
      **Platform variation**: Confirm how your platform counts multi-credit sessions against usage limits. Some systems count credits consumed, others count booking instances.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: Daily + weekly limits stacking">
    **Setup**:

    - Product: "Premium Membership"
    - Daily limit: 1 booking/day
    - Weekly limit: 5 bookings/week

    **Question**: What's the maximum weekly bookings?

    **Answer**: 5 bookings maximum (limited by weekly cap), spread across 5+ days

    **System behavior**:

    - Athlete can book once per day (daily limit)
    - Even if athlete books every day (7 days), weekly limit stops them at 5 bookings
    - Most restrictive limit always wins

    **Use case**: Daily limit ensures recovery/spacing, weekly limit caps total usage

    **Lesson**: Multiple limits can coexist; most restrictive applies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 4: Product restriction + scheduler eligibility">
    **Setup**:

    - Product A: "Basic Package" (restricted to Basic Scheduler A, B, C)
    - Product B: "Premium Package" (restricted to Premium Scheduler X, Y, Z)
    - Athlete has BOTH products

    **Question**: What happens when athlete tries to book Premium Scheduler X?

    **Answer**: System offers only Product B credits (Premium Package)

    **System behavior**:

    1. Athlete views Premium Scheduler X
    2. System checks all athlete's credit sources
    3. Product A credits: NOT shown (scheduler not in redeemable list)
    4. Product B credits: SHOWN (scheduler IS in redeemable list)
    5. Master Credits: SHOWN (if athlete has any)

    **Lesson**: System automatically filters which credit sources work for each scheduler
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preventing credit abuse

Strategic configurations to protect your business.

### Common abuse patterns and solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The Unlimited Hoarder">
    **Abuse pattern**: Athlete with unlimited monthly subscription books 20+ sessions in Week 1, blocks all capacity

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Weekly booking limits**
       - Set limit: "4 bookings per week"
       - Effect: Spreads bookings across month
       - Athlete still gets full value, but consistently
    2. **Daily booking limits**
       - Set limit: "1 booking per day"
       - Effect: Forces spacing between sessions
       - Prevents capacity blocking
    3. **Rolling booking windows**
       - Set scheduler: "Book maximum 7 days in advance"
       - Effect: Athlete can't book entire month Day 1
       - Opens capacity to others throughout month

    **Recommended configuration**:

    ```
    Product: "Unlimited Monthly Membership"
    Weekly limit: 3 bookings
    Daily limit: 1 booking
    Scheduler setting: 7-day advance booking window
    Result: Athlete books 3x/week (12/month), can't monopolize schedule
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The Account Sharer">
    **Abuse pattern**: Family shares one unlimited subscription, multiple people book under same account

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Weekly booking limits**
       - Set limit: "4 bookings per week"
       - Effect: Even if 2 people share, max 4 sessions/week total
       - Makes sharing less valuable
    2. **Photo verification** (operational)
       - Require profile photo
       - Coach checks booking vs athlete appearance
       - Catches most casual sharing
    3. **Single concurrent booking rule**
       - Technical: Prevent overlapping bookings on same account
       - If sharing, they can't both have sessions at same time
       - Limits sharing utility
    4. **Terms of service clause**
       - Legal: "Subscriptions non-transferable"
       - Right to cancel subscription if sharing detected
       - Enforcement tool if needed

    <Warning>
      **Balance enforcement with trust**: Heavy-handed anti-sharing measures can alienate legitimate athletes. Most coaches address on case-by-case basis.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The Cherry Picker">
    **Abuse pattern**: Athlete with unlimited subscription ONLY books your highest-cost/most popular sessions

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Per-scheduler limits**
       - Premium Scheduler A: "2 bookings per week max"
       - Standard Schedulers: Unlimited within weekly cap
       - Effect: Forces diversity in session types
    2. **Multi-credit premium sessions**
       - Make premium sessions cost 2+ credits
       - Even with unlimited credits, higher cost = psychological deterrent
       - Athlete reconsiders booking ONLY premium
    3. **Separate premium from unlimited**
       - Don't include ultra-premium sessions in unlimited subscription
       - Require separate add-on or credits
       - Example: "Unlimited Standard + 2 Premium Sessions/month"

    **Example configuration**:

    ```
    Product: "Unlimited Training Membership"
    Redeemable Schedulers:
      - Group Classes (unlimited, max 4/week)
      - Semi-Private (max 2/week, costs 1.5 credits)
      - Private Sessions (NOT INCLUDED)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The Binge Booker">
    **Abuse pattern**: Athlete uses all 10 credits in first 5 days, then requests refund claiming "not satisfied"

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Usage-based refund policy**
       - "Refunds available if 3 credits used"
       - After 3+ credits used, refund denied or pro-rated
       - Document in product description
    2. **Credit release schedule** (if available)
       - Release 2 credits per week over 5 weeks (for 10-credit package)
       - Athlete can't burn through immediately
       - Forces sustained engagement
    3. **Early engagement outreach**
       - After 1st session: "How was your experience?"
       - Catch dissatisfaction early
       - Prevents binge-then-refund pattern

    <Note>
      **Legal consideration**: Check local consumer protection laws around credit/stored value refunds before implementing restrictive refund policies.
    </Note>

## What athletes see when limits are hit

Understanding athlete experience helps you set appropriate limits and communicate clearly.

### Athlete-facing error messages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scheduler not in redeemable list">
    **What athlete sees**: When viewing scheduler, credit option doesn't appear in payment selection

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    - "Credits not available for this session"
    - Or: Payment options show only "Direct Payment: \$50" (no credit option)

    **Athlete confusion potential**: HIGH (they have credits but can't use them here)

    **Your prevention**:

    - Clear product descriptions: "Youth Program credits work ONLY for youth schedulers"
    - FAQ on your website explaining credit restrictions
    - During onboarding: "These credits are for [specific sessions]"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Daily booking limit reached">
    **What athlete sees**: Error message when attempting to book second session same day

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "You've reached your daily booking limit for [Product Name]
    You can book again tomorrow"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: MEDIUM

    **Your prevention**:

    - Product description: "Max 1 booking per day"
    - In-app calendar: Show dates when they can next book
    - Proactive communication: "Remember, you can book once daily with this membership"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly booking limit reached">
    **What athlete sees**: Error message when attempting to book 4th session in week (if limit is 3)

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "You've used 3 of 3 weekly bookings for [Product Name]
    Your weekly limit resets on Monday, [Date]"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: LOW (message is clear about reset)

    **Your prevention**:

    - Product description: "Max 3 sessions per week"
    - Weekly reminder email: "You have 1 booking remaining this week"
    - Show bookings used: "2/3 weekly bookings used"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient credits for multi-credit session">
    **What athlete sees**: Error when trying to book 2-credit session with only 1 credit remaining

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "Insufficient credits
    This session requires 2 credits, but you only have 1 credit available
    Purchase more credits or choose a different session"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: MEDIUM (might not realize this session costs more)

    **Your prevention**:

    - Scheduler name: "Private Training (2 Credits)" ← show cost in title
    - Session description: Clearly state credit cost upfront
    - Booking page: Display credit cost before athlete selects date/time

  <Accordion title="Monthly booking limit reached">
    **What athlete sees**: Error when attempting to book 13th session in month (if limit is 12)

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "You've reached your monthly booking limit for [Product Name]
    Monthly limit: 12 bookings
    Your limit resets on [Renewal Date]"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: MEDIUM-HIGH (might feel cheated if expecting "unlimited")

    **Your prevention**:

    - NEVER call it "unlimited" if there's a monthly cap
    - Product name: "12-Session Monthly Membership" (not "Unlimited")
    - Product description: "Book up to 12 sessions per month (resets monthly)"
    - Marketing: Frame as "3x/week training" not "unlimited"

    <Warning>
      **Legal risk**: Advertising "unlimited" when a monthly cap exists may violate consumer protection laws in some jurisdictions. Be explicit about limits.

## Viewing athlete usage limits

Where coaches see limit consumption.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to athlete profile">
    Dashboard → **People** → **Clients** → [Athlete Name]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Credits section">
    Click **Credits** tab or section in athlete profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select product-specific tab">
    Click the tab for the subscription/product with usage limits configured

    **Example**: "Month to Month Rising Stars Membership"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Usage Limits Log">
    Look for "Usage limits log" link or "View limits" button

    **Click** to open usage tracking details

    <Frame>
      ![Usage limits tracking in athlete profile](/images/athlete-credit-usage-limits.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review usage data">
    **What you'll see**:

    - **Daily usage**: "1 of 1 bookings today"
    - **Weekly usage**: "2 of 3 bookings this week" (resets Monday)
    - **Monthly usage**: "8 of 12 bookings this month" (resets on renewal date)
    - **Per-scheduler usage**: "Rising Stars Shooting Lab: 1 of 2 weekly bookings"

    **Use this to**:

    - Verify athlete is under/at limits
    - Troubleshoot "can't book" complaints
    - Monitor if limits are too restrictive or too loose
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Weekly monitoring**: Review top users weekly. If many athletes consistently hit limits, consider adjusting (limits may be too restrictive). If no one hits limits, they may be too generous.
</Tip>

## Common limit configuration strategies

Proven approaches by business model.

### For unlimited subscriptions

**The "3x/week" model:**

```
Product: "Unlimited Monthly Training"
Price: $400/month
Weekly limit: 3 bookings
Daily limit: 1 booking
Expected usage: 12 sessions/month (3 per week × 4 weeks)
Per-session cost to you: $33
Profit margin: 35%+ (if your costs are <$25/session)
```

**Why it works**:

- "Unlimited" sounds attractive (great marketing)
- Weekly limit prevents abuse (protects margins)
- Daily limit encourages consistency (better athlete results)
- Predictable usage (12 sessions/month average)

---

**The "Tiered Unlimited" model:**

```
Product: "Unlimited Standard Classes"
Price: $250/month
Redeemable schedulers: Standard group classes only
Weekly limit: 4 bookings
Premium sessions: NOT included

Separate Add-On: "Premium Add-On Pack"
Price: +$150/month
Unlocks: 2 premium sessions per month
```

**Why it works**:

- Base subscription is affordable, mass-market
- Premium add-on captures high-value athletes
- Clear product differentiation
- Upsell path for engaged athletes

---

### For credit packages (finite credits)

**The "Flex Package" model:**

```
Product: "10-Credit Flex Package"
Price: $450
Redeemable schedulers: 
  - Group Classes (1 credit)
  - Semi-Private (1.5 credits) 
  - Private Training (2 credits)
No usage frequency limits (credit count is the limit)
```

**Why it works**:

- Athlete chooses session types based on needs
- Multi-credit premium sessions reflect value
- No weekly limits needed (10 credits is finite)
- Simple for athletes to understand

---

**The "Program Package" model:**

```
Product: "8-Week Youth Development Package"
Price: $600
Redeemable schedulers: Youth program sessions only
Credits issued: 16 (for 2x/week × 8 weeks)
Weekly limit: 2 bookings (enforces program structure)
Expiration: 10 weeks (2-week grace period)
```

**Why it works**:

- Structured program with defined timeline
- Weekly limit maintains consistency
- Scheduler restriction ensures program integrity
- Expiration creates urgency

---

### For facility owners (multi-program)

**The "All-Access Pass" model:**

```
Product: "Facility All-Access Pass"
Price: $500/month
Redeemable schedulers: ALL facility programs
Weekly limit: 5 bookings total
Per-program limits:
  - Open Gym: unlimited (within weekly 5)
  - Classes: max 3 per week
  - Clinics: max 1 per week
Daily limit: 2 bookings
```

**Why it works**:

- Appeals to multi-sport/cross-training athletes
- Per-program limits protect high-cost offerings
- Weekly cap controls overall usage
- Daily limit prevents same-day hoarding

---

## Troubleshooting limit issues

When limits aren't working as expected.

### Issue: Athlete reports they can't book but haven't hit limit

**Diagnostic steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify limit status">
    Athlete Profile → Credits → [Product Tab] → Usage Limits Log

    **Check**:

    - Daily bookings: X of Y used
    - Weekly bookings: X of Y used
    - Per-scheduler bookings: X of Y used

    **If under all limits**: Continue troubleshooting
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check scheduler restrictions">
    **Verify**: Is the scheduler athlete is trying to book in product's "Redeemable Schedulers" list?

    **How to check**:

    1. Payments → Products → [Product] → Redeemable Schedulers section
    2. Look for scheduler name
    3. If NOT listed → That's the problem (scheduler restriction blocking)

    **Solution**: Either add scheduler to redeemable list OR athlete needs different credit type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify credit balance">
    **Check**: Does athlete have enough credits for this scheduler's cost?

    **Example issue**:

    - Scheduler requires 2 credits
    - Athlete has 1 credit remaining
    - System blocks booking (insufficient credits)

    **Solution**: Athlete needs to purchase more credits or use Master Credits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check subscription status on Stripe">
    If subscription credits:

    **Verify**: Payments → Subscriptions → Is subscription "Active" on Stripe?

    **If inactive**: Credits become unusable even if balance exists

    **Solution**: Athlete must resolve payment issue to reactivate subscription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test booking yourself">
    **As coach**:

    1. Navigate to Calendar
    2. Manually book athlete into session
    3. If booking succeeds: Issue is app/athlete-side
    4. If booking fails: You'll see the actual error message

    **Common discoveries**:

    - Session is full (capacity issue, not limit issue)
    - Athlete has conflicting booking
    - Time slot outside scheduling window
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Issue: Limits resetting at wrong time

**Common problem**: Weekly limit should reset Monday but resets Sunday

**Causes**:

1. **Timezone mismatch**: Coach timezone vs athlete timezone vs server timezone
2. **Subscription cycle**: Monthly limits reset on subscription renewal date (varies per athlete)
3. **Configuration error**: Limit set incorrectly during product setup

**Solutions**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fix Timezone Settings">
    **Check coach timezone**:

    1. Dashboard → Settings → Account Settings
    2. Verify timezone matches your actual location
    3. Update if incorrect

    **Check athlete timezone** (if individual athlete settings available):

    1. Athlete Profile → Settings
    2. Verify timezone
    3. Update if incorrect

    **Result**: Limits should reset at correct time in appropriate timezone
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Understand Subscription Cycles">
    **Monthly limits work differently**:

    - NOT calendar month (Jan 1 - Jan 31)
    - Subscription billing cycle (e.g., purchased Jan 15 = resets Feb 15)
    - Each athlete has different reset date based on purchase date

    **This is correct behavior**: Monthly limits align with billing, not calendar

    **Athlete communication**: "Your 12-session monthly limit resets on [Your Renewal Date]"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reconfigure Limits">
    If limits are genuinely wrong:

    1. Payments → Products → [Product] → Edit
    2. Review usage limit settings
    3. Correct values
    4. Save
    5. Verify: Check test athlete to confirm correct reset behavior

    <Note>
      **Retroactive fix**: Changing limits going forward doesn't fix past incorrect resets. May need to manually adjust athlete usage counts if critically wrong.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Issue: Athletes complaining limits are too restrictive

**Athlete feedback**: "I can only book 3 times per week? That's not enough!"

**Decision framework**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review actual usage data">
    **Question**: Are athletes ACTUALLY hitting limits regularly?

    **How to check**:

    1. Pull report of athletes on this product
    2. Count how many hit weekly limit each week
    3. Calculate percentage

    **If 10% hitting limits**: Limits are fine, athlete is outlier (educate on product design)

    **If \>30% hitting limits**: Limits may be too restrictive (consider adjustment)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare to pricing model">
    **Question**: Is limit aligned with what product should deliver?

    **Example**:

    - Product: "\$300/month Unlimited Training"
    - Weekly limit: 3 bookings = 12 sessions/month
    - Per-session cost to business: \$25
    - Total cost: \$300 (break-even pricing)

    **If limit aligned with pricing**: Limits are correct (athlete wants more than product offers)

    **If limit too restrictive for price**: Consider increasing limit or lowering price
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer upsell/alternative">
    **Response to athlete**:

    "The [Product Name] membership is designed for 3x/week training (12 sessions/month). If you'd like to train more frequently, I have these options:

    1. **Upgrade to [Premium Product]**: 5x/week training (20 sessions/month) for \$450/month
    2. **Add credits**: Purchase additional credit packages to supplement your membership
    3. **Hybrid approach**: Use direct payment (\$50/session) for extra sessions beyond your 3/week

    Let me know which works best for your goals!"

    <Tip>
      **Positioning**: Frame as athlete's growth/commitment deserves premium product, not as limit being wrong
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust limits if necessary">
    If data shows limits are genuinely too tight:

    1. Increase weekly limit (e.g., 3 → 4 bookings)
    2. Or: Increase price to match higher usage (e.g., $300 → $350 for 4/week)
    3. Communicate change to all athletes on product
    4. Monitor usage for 30 days to verify adjustment worked

    **Grandfather existing athletes**: Consider keeping current price for existing athletes when raising price for new sign-ups
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices for setting limits

Strategic guidance for different scenarios.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Conservative" icon="shield">
    **Principle**: Easier to loosen limits than tighten them

    **Approach**:

    - Launch new unlimited product with 3/week limit
    - Monitor usage for 60 days
    - If 20% hit limits, consider increasing to 4/week
    - If 40% hit limits, limits may be too tight

    **Why**: Increasing limits feels like a gift to athletes. Decreasing limits feels like taking away value (negative sentiment).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Align Limits with Marketing" icon="bullseye">
    **Principle**: What you advertise should match what limits allow

    **Examples**:

    - ✅ "3x/Week Training" + 3 bookings/week limit
    - ✅ "Unlimited Classes (up to 4/week)" + 4 bookings/week limit
    - ❌ "Unlimited Training" + 3 bookings/week limit (misleading)

    **Why**: Truth in advertising prevents athlete frustration and legal issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Limits for Product Differentiation" icon="layer-group">
    **Principle**: Limits define product tiers

    **Example structure**:

    - **Basic**: 2 bookings/week, \$200/month
    - **Standard**: 3 bookings/week, \$300/month
    - **Premium**: 5 bookings/week, \$450/month

    **Why**: Clear value progression encourages upgrades
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor and Iterate" icon="chart-line">
    **Principle**: Limits aren't set-it-and-forget-it

    **Quarterly review**:

    - What % of athletes hit each limit type?
    - Are hit rates increasing or decreasing over time?
    - What's average usage vs limit?
    - Any athlete complaints or confusion?

    **Adjust**: Based on data, not individual complaints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate Limits Clearly" icon="comment-alt">
    **Principle**: No surprises

    **Where to communicate**:

    - Product name: "3x/Week Membership"
    - Product description: "Train up to 3 times per week"
    - Checkout page: "Includes 3 sessions per week"
    - Confirmation email: "You can book 3 sessions per week"
    - In-app display: "2/3 weekly bookings used"

    **Why**: Informed athletes are satisfied athletes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balance Business + Athlete Needs" icon="balance-scale">
    **Principle**: Limits should protect business WITHOUT frustrating athletes

    **Sweet spot**:

    - 80% of athletes never hit limits (limits are fair)
    - 15% occasionally hit limits (acceptable constraint)
    - 5% frequently hit limits (should upgrade to higher tier)

    **If different**: Adjust limits or pricing
  </Card>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I set different limits for different athletes on same product?">
    **Short answer**: No (typically)

    **How product limits work**: Limits are set at product level, apply to ALL athletes who have that product

    **Workaround options**:

    1. **Create custom products for VIP athletes**
       - Example: "VIP 5x/Week Membership" for athlete who needs more
       - Manually assign at custom price
    2. **Use Master Credits for exceptions**
       - Athlete hits weekly limit on subscription
       - Grant Master Credits to supplement
    3. **Hybrid product strategy**
       - Base subscription with limits
       - Sell additional credit packs for overflow

    <Note>
      **Platform limitation**: Individual-athlete limit overrides are rare. Design products to fit 80% of use cases, handle exceptions manually.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I change limits on existing product?">
    **Effect**: Changes apply immediately to all athletes with that product

    **Example scenario**:

    - Product currently has 3 bookings/week limit
    - You change to 4 bookings/week
    - All athletes immediately can book 4/week going forward

    **Athlete notification**: System typically does NOT auto-notify athletes of limit changes

    **Your action required**:

    1. Email all athletes on product about change
    2. Update product description on website
    3. Post announcement in-app (if available)

    **Retroactive**: Changing limits does NOT affect past usage (can't "give back" usage from previous weeks)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes see their usage limits?">
    **Yes**: Athletes can view their usage in Athlete Portal

    **Location**: Athlete Portal → Settings → Billing → [Product Name]

    **What they see**:

    - Credit balance
    - Redeemable Sessions list
    - Usage: "2 of 3 weekly bookings used"
    - Reset date: "Resets Monday, Oct 7"

    **Benefit**: Self-service transparency reduces "Why can't I book?" questions

    <Tip>
      **Guide athletes**: During onboarding, show them where to check usage. "You can always see your weekly bookings used in Settings → Billing"
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do Master Credits have usage limits?">
    **No**: Master Credits typically have NO usage limits (unless you manually configure)

    **Why**: Master Credits are designed as flexible override mechanism

    **Use case**:

    - Athlete hits weekly limit on subscription
    - You grant Master Credits as bonus/compensation
    - Athlete can use Master Credits even though subscription limit hit

    **Configuration option**: Some platforms allow setting limits on Master Credits, but this is rare and not recommended (defeats purpose of Master Credits)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use limits for finite credit packages?">
    **Generally no**: Finite packages are self-limiting (10 credits = maximum 10 sessions)

    **Exception scenarios where limits make sense**:

    1. **Program integrity**
       - 8-week program with 16 credits
       - Weekly limit: 2 bookings (enforces 2x/week structure)
       - Without limit: Athlete might book 8 sessions Week 1 (defeats program design)
    2. **Capacity protection**
       - Small group training with limited spots
       - Daily limit: 1 booking (prevents single athlete from booking multiple spots same day)
    3. **Expiration alignment**
       - 10-credit package expires in 5 weeks
       - Weekly limit: 2 bookings (paces usage to avoid last-minute rush)

    **Default recommendation**: No limits on standard finite packages (credit count is sufficient control)
