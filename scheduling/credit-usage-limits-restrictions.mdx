## Understanding credit usage limits

Credit usage limits give you control over **how** and **where** athletes can redeem their credits. Without limits, athletes could potentially abuse unlimited subscriptions or use credits in ways that harm your business model.

### Why limits matter

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Business Protection">
    **Scenarios limits prevent:**

    ‚ùå Athlete with unlimited monthly credits books 30 sessions in one day\
    ‚ùå Athlete shares unlimited subscription with friends who book under their account\
    ‚ùå Athlete uses premium package credits for basic sessions (margin erosion)\
    ‚ùå Athlete books all high-demand time slots, blocking other paying athletes\
    ‚ùå Family shares one subscription across multiple people

    **Result without limits**: Revenue loss, capacity problems, unfair access distribution

    **Result with limits**: Predictable usage, fair access, protected margins
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Athlete Fairness">
    **Limits create fairness:**

    ‚úÖ Prevents one athlete from monopolizing popular time slots\
    ‚úÖ Ensures all subscription holders get equitable access\
    ‚úÖ Stops credit hoarding behavior\
    ‚úÖ Encourages consistent training vs binge booking\
    ‚úÖ Maintains capacity for new athlete acquisition

    **Example**: Monthly unlimited subscription with "3 bookings per week" limit ensures athletes train consistently rather than booking 12 sessions in Week 1 and none in Weeks 2-4.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Business Model Alignment">
    **Limits align pricing with value:**

    ‚úÖ Premium schedulers can require more credits (2 credits for advanced training)\
    ‚úÖ Restrict basic package credits to basic schedulers only\
    ‚úÖ Force high-value sessions to require premium subscriptions\
    ‚úÖ Create clear product tiers with different access levels\
    ‚úÖ Protect high-margin offerings

    **Example**: "$200/month Youth Program" credits only work for youth schedulers, not your $75/session private training.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Types of credit restrictions

CoachIQ offers multiple restriction mechanisms. Understanding each type helps you build the right control structure.

### Scheduler-specific restrictions

**What it does**: Limits which schedulers accept credits from a specific product/subscription

**How it works**: When creating a product, you select which schedulers can redeem these credits. Athletes can ONLY use these credits for designated schedulers.

**Example configuration:**

```
Product: "Rising Stars Youth Membership - $250/month"
Credits Issued: Unlimited (‚àû)
Redeemable Schedulers:
  ‚úì Rising Stars Class
  ‚úì Rising Stars Shooting Lab
  ‚úì Rising Stars Open Gym
  ‚úó Elite Training (not included)
  ‚úó Private Sessions (not included)
```

**Athlete experience**: When booking "Elite Training," these credits won't show as payment option. They'll need Master Credits or direct payment.

<Tip>
  **Best practice**: Scheduler-specific restrictions are your FIRST line of defense. Always configure these when creating products.
</Tip>

---

### Usage frequency limits

**What it does**: Controls how many times per day/week/month athletes can book using credits

**Common configurations:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Booking Limit">
    **Example**: "Maximum 1 booking per day"

    **Use case**: Prevent athletes from booking multiple sessions same day

    **Business reason**:

    - Ensures recovery time between sessions
    - Prevents capacity hoarding
    - Spreads demand across days

    **Athlete sees**: "You've reached your daily booking limit for this subscription"

    **Reset**: Midnight each day (coach's timezone)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly Booking Limit">
    **Example**: "Maximum 3 bookings per week"

    **Use case**: Control subscription usage to match pricing model

    **Business reason**:

    - "3x/week membership" = max 12 sessions/month at 3/week
    - Prevents binge booking (using all month's value in Week 1)
    - Predictable capacity planning

    **Athlete sees**: "You've used 3 of 3 weekly bookings for this subscription. Resets on Monday."

    **Reset**: Every Monday (or first day of athlete's subscription cycle)

    <Note>
      **Pro tip**: Weekly limits are most effective for unlimited subscriptions to prevent abuse while maintaining flexibility.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monthly Booking Limit">
    **Example**: "Maximum 12 bookings per month"

    **Use case**: Cap unlimited subscriptions to defined usage

    **Business reason**:

    - Unlimited subscriptions need reasonable maximums
    - "12 bookings/month" = 3x/week average (sustainable)
    - Protects against extreme overuse

    **Athlete sees**: "You've used 12 of 12 monthly bookings. Resets on [renewal date]."

    **Reset**: Athlete's subscription renewal date (varies per athlete)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Per-Scheduler Limits">
    **Example**: "Maximum 2 bookings per week for Rising Stars Shooting Lab"

    **Use case**: Limit specific high-demand or high-cost schedulers

    **Business reason**:

    - Specialty sessions have higher overhead
    - Prevents athletes from only booking premium sessions
    - Encourages diverse training

    **Athlete sees**: "You've reached your limit for Rising Stars Shooting Lab this week (2/2 used)"

    **Reset**: Per scheduler, according to limit type (daily/weekly/monthly)

    <Tip>
      **Strategic use**: Great for balancing access to premium offerings within broader membership
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Multi-credit sessions

**What it does**: Makes certain schedulers cost MORE than 1 credit per booking

**How it works**: Configure scheduler to require 2, 3, or more credits per booking

**Use cases:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Premium Session Pricing">
    **Configuration**: Private training costs 2 credits, group class costs 1 credit

    **Business logic**:

    - Reflects higher value/cost of private sessions
    - Athlete with 10-credit package gets:
      - 10 group sessions OR
      - 5 private sessions OR
      - Mix (e.g., 6 group + 2 private = 10 credits)

    **Benefit**: Single package serves multiple session types with appropriate pricing

    **Example**:

    ```
    Package: "10-Credit Flex Package - $450"
    Session Types:
      - Group Training: 1 credit ($45 value)
      - Semi-Private (2 people): 1.5 credits ($67.50 value)
      - Private Training: 2 credits ($90 value)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Longer Session Duration">
    **Configuration**: 30-min session = 1 credit, 60-min session = 2 credits

    **Business logic**: Time-proportional pricing

    **Athlete choice**: Pick session length based on credit availability and goals

    **Example**:

    ```
    Scheduler Options:
      - 30-Min Quick Hit: 1 credit
      - 60-Min Full Training: 2 credits
      - 90-Min Extended Session: 3 credits
    ```

    **Flexibility**: Athlete with 5 credits could book 5√ó30min OR 2√ó60min + 1√ó30min
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specialty Services">
    **Configuration**: Standard training = 1 credit, video analysis session = 3 credits

    **Business logic**: Reflects additional coach prep time, technology costs, expertise

    **Use case**:

    - Video analysis requires 30min filming + 60min review + editing
    - Costs you more time/resources than standard session
    - 3 credits = appropriate compensation

    **Athlete perception**: Specialty service is premium offering (higher credit cost signals higher value)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Keep it simple**: Most coaches should stick to 1-2 credit variations max. Complex multi-credit systems confuse athletes and complicate booking.
</Warning>

## Configuring scheduler-specific restrictions

Step-by-step: Limiting credits to specific schedulers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to product builder">
    Dashboard ‚Üí **Payments** ‚Üí **Products** ‚Üí Select product ‚Üí **Edit**

    Or: Create new product and continue to credit configuration section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll to Credit Limits section">
    You'll see several configuration options:

    - **Add credits once purchased**: Number of credits issued (or ‚àû for unlimited)
    - **Credit expiration options**: Carry over vs expire
    - **Redeemable Schedulers**: üéØ THIS IS WHERE YOU SET RESTRICTIONS

    <Frame>
      ![Credit Limits configuration in product builder](/images/product-credit-limits-section.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Redeemable Schedulers">
    Click **Select Schedulers** or similar button

    **You'll see**:

    - List of all your active schedulers
    - Checkboxes next to each scheduler
    - Search/filter options (if many schedulers)

    **Action**: Check ONLY the schedulers where these credits should work

    <Tip>
      **Strategic thinking**: Leave unchecked = credits won't work there (athlete will need Master Credits or direct payment)
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure scheduler-level details (if available)">
    Some products allow per-scheduler limits:

    **Example**:

    ```
    Rising Stars Membership - Redeemable Schedulers:
      ‚úì Rising Stars Class (Unlimited bookings)
      ‚úì Rising Stars Shooting Lab (Max 2/week)
      ‚úì Rising Stars Open Gym (Max 4/month)
    ```

    **Configuration**: Click scheduler to expand advanced settings

    **Set**: Daily, weekly, or monthly limits per scheduler
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    Click **Save** or **Update Product**

    **Verification checklist**:

    1. Product shows selected schedulers in "Redeemable Schedulers" section
    2. Athlete profile shows these schedulers under product's credit tab
    3. Test booking: Athlete can book selected schedulers, blocked from others

    <Check>
      **Success!** Credits are now restricted to designated schedulers only.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring usage frequency limits

Setting daily, weekly, or monthly booking caps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open product credit limits">
    Dashboard ‚Üí **Payments** ‚Üí **Products** ‚Üí [Product] ‚Üí **Edit** ‚Üí **Credit Limits** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Usage Limits configuration">
    Look for section labeled:

    - "Usage Limits"
    - "Booking Frequency"
    - "Credit Usage Restrictions"
    - Or similar naming

    <Note>
      **Platform variation**: Exact naming and location may vary. If you don't see these options, usage limits may be configured at the scheduler level instead of product level.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set frequency limit">
    **Options you might see**:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Daily Limit">
        **Setting**: "Maximum bookings per day: [X]"

        **Example**: Set to "1" for "max 1 booking per day"

        **Effect**: Athlete can book once daily using these credits, resets at midnight

        **Best for**: Preventing same-day multi-booking
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Weekly Limit">
        **Setting**: "Maximum bookings per week: [X]"

        **Example**: Set to "3" for "max 3 bookings per week"

        **Effect**: Athlete can book 3 times weekly using these credits, resets Monday

        **Best for**: Unlimited subscriptions with consistent usage expectations

        <Tip>
          **Recommended for unlimited subscriptions**: Set weekly limit = (monthly expected usage √∑ 4 weeks). Example: 12 sessions/month target = 3/week limit.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Monthly Limit">
        **Setting**: "Maximum bookings per month: [X]"

        **Example**: Set to "12" for "max 12 bookings per month"

        **Effect**: Athlete can book 12 times monthly using these credits, resets on renewal date

        **Best for**: Subscription cap that aligns with billing cycle
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    **Save** product configuration

    **Test scenario**:

    1. Assign product to test athlete
    2. Have them book sessions up to limit
    3. Attempt to book one more
    4. Should see: "You've reached your [daily/weekly/monthly] booking limit for [Product Name]"

    **Verify**: Limit resets at appropriate time (daily, weekly, monthly)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Limit stacking**: If you set BOTH weekly (3 bookings) AND daily (1 booking) limits, the more restrictive limit applies. Athlete can't book 3 times in one day even though weekly limit is 3.
</Warning>

---

## Configuring multi-credit sessions

Making certain schedulers cost multiple credits per booking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to scheduler settings">
    Dashboard ‚Üí **Schedule** ‚Üí **Schedulers** ‚Üí Select scheduler ‚Üí **Settings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find payment/pricing section">
    Scroll to "Payment Options" or "Pricing" section

    You'll see options for:

    - Free
    - Direct Payment (\$ amount)
    - Credit Redemption ‚Üê THIS IS WHERE YOU CONFIGURE

    <Frame>
      ![Scheduler payment configuration](/images/scheduler-payment-options.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set credit cost">
    **Look for**: "Credits required" or "Credit cost" field

    **Configuration options**:

    - **1 credit** (default/standard)
    - **2 credits** (common for premium)
    - **3+ credits** (specialty/extended sessions)
    - **0.5 credits** (half-sessions, if you want to use fractional credits)

    **Select**: Number of credits this scheduler requires per booking

    <Note>
      **Recommendation**: Stick to whole numbers (1, 2, 3) for simplicity. Fractional credits (0.5, 1.5) work but confuse some athletes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure hybrid payment (optional)">
    If you want to offer BOTH credit AND direct payment options:

    **Example**: "2 Credits OR \$90"

    **Configuration**:

    - Credits required: 2
    - Direct payment amount: \$90
    - Enable both options

    **Athlete choice**: At booking, athlete chooses payment method (use 2 credits OR pay \$90)

    <Tip>
      **Strategic pricing**: Price direct payment higher than credit-equivalent to incentivize package purchases.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    **Save** scheduler settings

    **Test**:

    1. Athlete with credits attempts to book
    2. System should deduct 2 credits (or configured amount)
    3. Credit logs should show: "-2 Credits | Redeemed for [Scheduler Name]"
    4. Athlete's balance decreases by 2

    <Check>
      **Success!** Scheduler now costs multiple credits per booking.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding limit interactions

How different limits work together (and sometimes conflict).

### Limit priority hierarchy

When multiple limits exist, this is the order CoachIQ enforces:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Scheduler-specific restrictions (highest priority)">
    **Question**: Can this product's credits even be used for this scheduler?

    **Check**: Is scheduler in product's "Redeemable Schedulers" list?

    **If NO**: Booking blocked entirely (other limits don't matter)

    **If YES**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Credit balance check">
    **Question**: Does athlete have enough credits?

    **Check**: Athlete's credit balance ‚â• scheduler's credit cost?

    **If NO**: Booking blocked (athlete needs more credits)

    **If YES**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Usage frequency limits">
    **Question**: Has athlete hit daily/weekly/monthly booking limit?

    **Check**: Current bookings vs limit for this product

    **If limit reached**: Booking blocked (athlete must wait for reset)

    **If under limit**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Scheduler capacity">
    **Question**: Is there room in the session?

    **Check**: Current bookings vs max capacity

    **If full**: Booking blocked (session full)

    **If space available**: ‚úÖ **Booking allowed**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example limit interaction scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Master Credits bypass scheduler restrictions">
    **Setup**:

    - Athlete has "Youth Program" subscription (restricted to youth schedulers only)
    - Athlete also has 2 Master Credits

    **Question**: Can athlete use Master Credits for adult scheduler not in youth subscription?

    **Answer**: YES! Master Credits have no scheduler restrictions

    **System behavior**:

    1. Athlete views adult scheduler
    2. Youth subscription credits NOT shown as payment option (restricted)
    3. Master Credits ARE shown as payment option
    4. Athlete can book using Master Credits

    **Lesson**: Master Credits are ultimate override for scheduler restrictions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Weekly limit + multi-credit session">
    **Setup**:

    - Product: "Unlimited Monthly" with 3 bookings/week limit
    - Scheduler: "Private Training" costs 2 credits/booking

    **Question**: Can athlete book 3 Private Training sessions in one week?

    **Answer**: NO (probably)

    **System behavior**:

    - First booking: Uses 2 credits, counts as 1 booking toward weekly limit (1/3)
    - Second booking: Uses 2 credits, counts as 1 booking toward weekly limit (2/3)
    - Third booking: Uses 2 credits, counts as 1 booking toward weekly limit (3/3)
    - Fourth attempt: BLOCKED (weekly limit reached, even though credits still unlimited)

    **Lesson**: Usage limits count BOOKINGS, not credits consumed

    <Note>
      **Platform variation**: Confirm how your platform counts multi-credit sessions against usage limits. Some systems count credits consumed, others count booking instances.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: Daily + weekly limits stacking">
    **Setup**:

    - Product: "Premium Membership"
    - Daily limit: 1 booking/day
    - Weekly limit: 5 bookings/week

    **Question**: What's the maximum weekly bookings?

    **Answer**: 5 bookings maximum (limited by weekly cap), spread across 5+ days

    **System behavior**:

    - Athlete can book once per day (daily limit)
    - Even if athlete books every day (7 days), weekly limit stops them at 5 bookings
    - Most restrictive limit always wins

    **Use case**: Daily limit ensures recovery/spacing, weekly limit caps total usage

    **Lesson**: Multiple limits can coexist; most restrictive applies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 4: Product restriction + scheduler eligibility">
    **Setup**:

    - Product A: "Basic Package" (restricted to Basic Scheduler A, B, C)
    - Product B: "Premium Package" (restricted to Premium Scheduler X, Y, Z)
    - Athlete has BOTH products

    **Question**: What happens when athlete tries to book Premium Scheduler X?

    **Answer**: System offers only Product B credits (Premium Package)

    **System behavior**:

    1. Athlete views Premium Scheduler X
    2. System checks all athlete's credit sources
    3. Product A credits: NOT shown (scheduler not in redeemable list)
    4. Product B credits: SHOWN (scheduler IS in redeemable list)
    5. Master Credits: SHOWN (if athlete has any)

    **Lesson**: System automatically filters which credit sources work for each scheduler
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preventing credit abuse

Strategic configurations to protect your business.

### Common abuse patterns and solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The Unlimited Hoarder">
    **Abuse pattern**: Athlete with unlimited monthly subscription books 20+ sessions in Week 1, blocks all capacity

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Weekly booking limits**
       - Set limit: "4 bookings per week"
       - Effect: Spreads bookings across month
       - Athlete still gets full value, but consistently
    2. **Daily booking limits**
       - Set limit: "1 booking per day"
       - Effect: Forces spacing between sessions
       - Prevents capacity blocking
    3. **Rolling booking windows**
       - Set scheduler: "Book maximum 7 days in advance"
       - Effect: Athlete can't book entire month Day 1
       - Opens capacity to others throughout month

    **Recommended configuration**:

    ```
    Product: "Unlimited Monthly Membership"
    Weekly limit: 3 bookings
    Daily limit: 1 booking
    Scheduler setting: 7-day advance booking window
    Result: Athlete books 3x/week (12/month), can't monopolize schedule
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The Account Sharer">
    **Abuse pattern**: Family shares one unlimited subscription, multiple people book under same account

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Weekly booking limits**
       - Set limit: "4 bookings per week"
       - Effect: Even if 2 people share, max 4 sessions/week total
       - Makes sharing less valuable
    2. **Photo verification** (operational)
       - Require profile photo
       - Coach checks booking vs athlete appearance
       - Catches most casual sharing
    3. **Single concurrent booking rule**
       - Technical: Prevent overlapping bookings on same account
       - If sharing, they can't both have sessions at same time
       - Limits sharing utility
    4. **Terms of service clause**
       - Legal: "Subscriptions non-transferable"
       - Right to cancel subscription if sharing detected
       - Enforcement tool if needed

    <Warning>
      **Balance enforcement with trust**: Heavy-handed anti-sharing measures can alienate legitimate athletes. Most coaches address on case-by-case basis.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The Cherry Picker">
    **Abuse pattern**: Athlete with unlimited subscription ONLY books your highest-cost/most popular sessions

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Per-scheduler limits**
       - Premium Scheduler A: "2 bookings per week max"
       - Standard Schedulers: Unlimited within weekly cap
       - Effect: Forces diversity in session types
    2. **Multi-credit premium sessions**
       - Make premium sessions cost 2+ credits
       - Even with unlimited credits, higher cost = psychological deterrent
       - Athlete reconsiders booking ONLY premium
    3. **Separate premium from unlimited**
       - Don't include ultra-premium sessions in unlimited subscription
       - Require separate add-on or credits
       - Example: "Unlimited Standard + 2 Premium Sessions/month"

    **Example configuration**:

    ```
    Product: "Unlimited Training Membership"
    Redeemable Schedulers:
      - Group Classes (unlimited, max 4/week)
      - Semi-Private (max 2/week, costs 1.5 credits)
      - Private Sessions (NOT INCLUDED)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The Binge Booker">
    **Abuse pattern**: Athlete uses all 10 credits in first 5 days, then requests refund claiming "not satisfied"

    **Prevention strategies**:

    1. **Usage-based refund policy**
       - "Refunds available if 3 credits used"
       - After 3+ credits used, refund denied or pro-rated
       - Document in product description
    2. **Credit release schedule** (if available)
       - Release 2 credits per week over 5 weeks (for 10-credit package)
       - Athlete can't burn through immediately
       - Forces sustained engagement
    3. **Early engagement outreach**
       - After 1st session: "How was your experience?"
       - Catch dissatisfaction early
       - Prevents binge-then-refund pattern

    <Note>
      **Legal consideration**: Check local consumer protection laws around credit/stored value refunds before implementing restrictive refund policies.
    </Note>

## What athletes see when limits are hit

Understanding athlete experience helps you set appropriate limits and communicate clearly.

### Athlete-facing error messages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scheduler not in redeemable list">
    **What athlete sees**: When viewing scheduler, credit option doesn't appear in payment selection

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    - "Credits not available for this session"
    - Or: Payment options show only "Direct Payment: \$50" (no credit option)

    **Athlete confusion potential**: HIGH (they have credits but can't use them here)

    **Your prevention**:

    - Clear product descriptions: "Youth Program credits work ONLY for youth schedulers"
    - FAQ on your website explaining credit restrictions
    - During onboarding: "These credits are for [specific sessions]"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Daily booking limit reached">
    **What athlete sees**: Error message when attempting to book second session same day

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "You've reached your daily booking limit for [Product Name]
    You can book again tomorrow"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: MEDIUM

    **Your prevention**:

    - Product description: "Max 1 booking per day"
    - In-app calendar: Show dates when they can next book
    - Proactive communication: "Remember, you can book once daily with this membership"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly booking limit reached">
    **What athlete sees**: Error message when attempting to book 4th session in week (if limit is 3)

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "You've used 3 of 3 weekly bookings for [Product Name]
    Your weekly limit resets on Monday, [Date]"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: LOW (message is clear about reset)

    **Your prevention**:

    - Product description: "Max 3 sessions per week"
    - Weekly reminder email: "You have 1 booking remaining this week"
    - Show bookings used: "2/3 weekly bookings used"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient credits for multi-credit session">
    **What athlete sees**: Error when trying to book 2-credit session with only 1 credit remaining

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "Insufficient credits
    This session requires 2 credits, but you only have 1 credit available
    Purchase more credits or choose a different session"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: MEDIUM (might not realize this session costs more)

    **Your prevention**:

    - Scheduler name: "Private Training (2 Credits)" ‚Üê show cost in title
    - Session description: Clearly state credit cost upfront
    - Booking page: Display credit cost before athlete selects date/time
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monthly booking limit reached">
    **What athlete sees**: Error when attempting to book 13th session in month (if limit is 12)

    **Exact message** (approximate):

    ```
    "You've reached your monthly booking limit for [Product Name]
    Monthly limit: 12 bookings
    Your limit resets on [Renewal Date]"
    ```

    **Athlete confusion potential**: MEDIUM-HIGH (might feel cheated if expecting "unlimited")

    **Your prevention**:

    - NEVER call it "unlimited" if there's a monthly cap
    - Product name: "12-Session Monthly Membership" (not "Unlimited")
    - Product description: "Book up to 12 sessions per month (resets monthly)"
    - Marketing: Frame as "3x/week training" not "unlimited"

    <Warning>
      **Legal risk**: Advertising "unlimited" when a monthly cap exists may violate consumer protection laws in some jurisdictions. Be explicit about limits.

## Viewing athlete usage limits

Where coaches see limit consumption.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to athlete profile">
    Dashboard ‚Üí **People** ‚Üí **Clients** ‚Üí [Athlete Name]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Credits section">
    Click **Credits** tab or section in athlete profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select product-specific tab">
    Click the tab for the subscription/product with usage limits configured

    **Example**: "Month to Month Rising Stars Membership"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Usage Limits Log">
    Look for "Usage limits log" link or "View limits" button

    **Click** to open usage tracking details

    <Frame>
      ![Usage limits tracking in athlete profile](/images/athlete-credit-usage-limits.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review usage data">
    **What you'll see**:

    - **Daily usage**: "1 of 1 bookings today"
    - **Weekly usage**: "2 of 3 bookings this week" (resets Monday)
    - **Monthly usage**: "8 of 12 bookings this month" (resets on renewal date)
    - **Per-scheduler usage**: "Rising Stars Shooting Lab: 1 of 2 weekly bookings"

    **Use this to**:

    - Verify athlete is under/at limits
    - Troubleshoot "can't book" complaints
    - Monitor if limits are too restrictive or too loose
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Weekly monitoring**: Review top users weekly. If many athletes consistently hit limits, consider adjusting (limits may be too restrictive). If no one hits limits, they may be too generous.
</Tip>

## Common limit configuration strategies

Proven approaches by business model.

### For unlimited subscriptions

**The "3x/week" model:**

```
Product: "Unlimited Monthly Training"
Price: $400/month
Weekly limit: 3 bookings
Daily limit: 1 booking
Expected usage: 12 sessions/month (3 per week √ó 4 weeks)
Per-session cost to you: $33
Profit margin: 35%+ (if your costs are <$25/session)
```

**Why it works**:

- "Unlimited" sounds attractive (great marketing)
- Weekly limit prevents abuse (protects margins)
- Daily limit encourages consistency (better athlete results)
- Predictable usage (12 sessions/month average)

---

**The "Tiered Unlimited" model:**

```
Product: "Unlimited Standard Classes"
Price: $250/month
Redeemable schedulers: Standard group classes only
Weekly limit: 4 bookings
Premium sessions: NOT included

Separate Add-On: "Premium Add-On Pack"
Price: +$150/month
Unlocks: 2 premium sessions per month
```

**Why it works**:

- Base subscription is affordable, mass-market
- Premium add-on captures high-value athletes
- Clear product differentiation
- Upsell path for engaged athletes

---

### For credit packages (finite credits)

**The "Flex Package" model:**

```
Product: "10-Credit Flex Package"
Price: $450
Redeemable schedulers: 
  - Group Classes (1 credit)
  - Semi-Private (1.5 credits) 
  - Private Training (2 credits)
No usage frequency limits (credit count is the limit)
```

**Why it works**:

- Athlete chooses session types based on needs
- Multi-credit premium sessions reflect value
- No weekly limits needed (10 credits is finite)
- Simple for athletes to understand

---

**The "Program Package" model:**

```
Product: "8-Week Youth Development Package"
Price: $600
Redeemable schedulers: Youth program sessions only
Credits issued: 16 (for 2x/week √ó 8 weeks)
Weekly limit: 2 bookings (enforces program structure)
Expiration: 10 weeks (2-week grace period)
```

**Why it works**:

- Structured program with defined timeline
- Weekly limit maintains consistency
- Scheduler restriction ensures program integrity
- Expiration creates urgency

---

### For facility owners (multi-program)

**The "All-Access Pass" model:**

```
Product: "Facility All-Access Pass"
Price: $500/month
Redeemable schedulers: ALL facility programs
Weekly limit: 5 bookings total
Per-program limits:
  - Open Gym: unlimited (within weekly 5)
  - Classes: max 3 per week
  - Clinics: max 1 per week
Daily limit: 2 bookings
```

**Why it works**:

- Appeals to multi-sport/cross-training athletes
- Per-program limits protect high-cost offerings
- Weekly cap controls overall usage
- Daily limit prevents same-day hoarding

---

## Troubleshooting limit issues

When limits aren't working as expected.

### Issue: Athlete reports they can't book but haven't hit limit

**Diagnostic steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify limit status">
    Athlete Profile ‚Üí Credits ‚Üí [Product Tab] ‚Üí Usage Limits Log

    **Check**:

    - Daily bookings: X of Y used
    - Weekly bookings: X of Y used
    - Per-scheduler bookings: X of Y used

    **If under all limits**: Continue troubleshooting
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check scheduler restrictions">
    **Verify**: Is the scheduler athlete is trying to book in product's "Redeemable Schedulers" list?

    **How to check**:

    1. Payments ‚Üí Products ‚Üí [Product] ‚Üí Redeemable Schedulers section
    2. Look for scheduler name
    3. If NOT listed ‚Üí That's the problem (scheduler restriction blocking)

    **Solution**: Either add scheduler to redeemable list OR athlete needs different credit type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify credit balance">
    **Check**: Does athlete have enough credits for this scheduler's cost?

    **Example issue**:

    - Scheduler requires 2 credits
    - Athlete has 1 credit remaining
    - System blocks booking (insufficient credits)

    **Solution**: Athlete needs to purchase more credits or use Master Credits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check subscription status on Stripe">
    If subscription credits:

    **Verify**: Payments ‚Üí Subscriptions ‚Üí Is subscription "Active" on Stripe?

    **If inactive**: Credits become unusable even if balance exists

    **Solution**: Athlete must resolve payment issue to reactivate subscription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test booking yourself">
    **As coach**:

    1. Navigate to Calendar
    2. Manually book athlete into session
    3. If booking succeeds: Issue is app/athlete-side
    4. If booking fails: You'll see the actual error message

    **Common discoveries**:

    - Session is full (capacity issue, not limit issue)
    - Athlete has conflicting booking
    - Time slot outside scheduling window
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Issue: Limits resetting at wrong time

**Common problem**: Weekly limit should reset Monday but resets Sunday

**Causes**:

1. **Timezone mismatch**: Coach timezone vs athlete timezone vs server timezone
2. **Subscription cycle**: Monthly limits reset on subscription renewal date (varies per athlete)
3. **Configuration error**: Limit set incorrectly during product setup

**Solutions**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fix Timezone Settings">
    **Check coach timezone**:

    1. Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Account Settings
    2. Verify timezone matches your actual location
    3. Update if incorrect

    **Check athlete timezone** (if individual athlete settings available):

    1. Athlete Profile ‚Üí Settings
    2. Verify timezone
    3. Update if incorrect

    **Result**: Limits should reset at correct time in appropriate timezone
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Understand Subscription Cycles">
    **Monthly limits work differently**:

    - NOT calendar month (Jan 1 - Jan 31)
    - Subscription billing cycle (e.g., purchased Jan 15 = resets Feb 15)
    - Each athlete has different reset date based on purchase date

    **This is correct behavior**: Monthly limits align with billing, not calendar

    **Athlete communication**: "Your 12-session monthly limit resets on [Your Renewal Date]"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reconfigure Limits">
    If limits are genuinely wrong:

    1. Payments ‚Üí Products ‚Üí [Product] ‚Üí Edit
    2. Review usage limit settings
    3. Correct values
    4. Save
    5. Verify: Check test athlete to confirm correct reset behavior

    <Note>
      **Retroactive fix**: Changing limits going forward doesn't fix past incorrect resets. May need to manually adjust athlete usage counts if critically wrong.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Issue: Athletes complaining limits are too restrictive

**Athlete feedback**: "I can only book 3 times per week? That's not enough!"

**Decision framework**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review actual usage data">
    **Question**: Are athletes ACTUALLY hitting limits regularly?

    **How to check**:

    1. Pull report of athletes on this product
    2. Count how many hit weekly limit each week
    3. Calculate percentage

    **If 10% hitting limits**: Limits are fine, athlete is outlier (educate on product design)

    **If \>30% hitting limits**: Limits may be too restrictive (consider adjustment)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare to pricing model">
    **Question**: Is limit aligned with what product should deliver?

    **Example**:

    - Product: "\$300/month Unlimited Training"
    - Weekly limit: 3 bookings = 12 sessions/month
    - Per-session cost to business: \$25
    - Total cost: \$300 (break-even pricing)

    **If limit aligned with pricing**: Limits are correct (athlete wants more than product offers)

    **If limit too restrictive for price**: Consider increasing limit or lowering price
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer upsell/alternative">
    **Response to athlete**:

    "The [Product Name] membership is designed for 3x/week training (12 sessions/month). If you'd like to train more frequently, I have these options:

    1. **Upgrade to [Premium Product]**: 5x/week training (20 sessions/month) for \$450/month
    2. **Add credits**: Purchase additional credit packages to supplement your membership
    3. **Hybrid approach**: Use direct payment (\$50/session) for extra sessions beyond your 3/week

    Let me know which works best for your goals!"

    <Tip>
      **Positioning**: Frame as athlete's growth/commitment deserves premium product, not as limit being wrong
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust limits if necessary">
    If data shows limits are genuinely too tight:

    1. Increase weekly limit (e.g., 3 ‚Üí 4 bookings)
    2. Or: Increase price to match higher usage (e.g., $300 ‚Üí $350 for 4/week)
    3. Communicate change to all athletes on product
    4. Monitor usage for 30 days to verify adjustment worked

    **Grandfather existing athletes**: Consider keeping current price for existing athletes when raising price for new sign-ups
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices for setting limits

Strategic guidance for different scenarios.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Conservative" icon="shield">
    **Principle**: Easier to loosen limits than tighten them

    **Approach**:

    - Launch new unlimited product with 3/week limit
    - Monitor usage for 60 days
    - If 20% hit limits, consider increasing to 4/week
    - If 40% hit limits, limits may be too tight

    **Why**: Increasing limits feels like a gift to athletes. Decreasing limits feels like taking away value (negative sentiment).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Align Limits with Marketing" icon="bullseye">
    **Principle**: What you advertise should match what limits allow

    **Examples**:

    - ‚úÖ "3x/Week Training" + 3 bookings/week limit
    - ‚úÖ "Unlimited Classes (up to 4/week)" + 4 bookings/week limit
    - ‚ùå "Unlimited Training" + 3 bookings/week limit (misleading)

    **Why**: Truth in advertising prevents athlete frustration and legal issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Limits for Product Differentiation" icon="layer-group">
    **Principle**: Limits define product tiers

    **Example structure**:

    - **Basic**: 2 bookings/week, \$200/month
    - **Standard**: 3 bookings/week, \$300/month
    - **Premium**: 5 bookings/week, \$450/month

    **Why**: Clear value progression encourages upgrades
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor and Iterate" icon="chart-line">
    **Principle**: Limits aren't set-it-and-forget-it

    **Quarterly review**:

    - What % of athletes hit each limit type?
    - Are hit rates increasing or decreasing over time?
    - What's average usage vs limit?
    - Any athlete complaints or confusion?

    **Adjust**: Based on data, not individual complaints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate Limits Clearly" icon="comment-alt">
    **Principle**: No surprises

    **Where to communicate**:

    - Product name: "3x/Week Membership"
    - Product description: "Train up to 3 times per week"
    - Checkout page: "Includes 3 sessions per week"
    - Confirmation email: "You can book 3 sessions per week"
    - In-app display: "2/3 weekly bookings used"

    **Why**: Informed athletes are satisfied athletes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balance Business + Athlete Needs" icon="balance-scale">
    **Principle**: Limits should protect business WITHOUT frustrating athletes

    **Sweet spot**:

    - 80% of athletes never hit limits (limits are fair)
    - 15% occasionally hit limits (acceptable constraint)
    - 5% frequently hit limits (should upgrade to higher tier)

    **If different**: Adjust limits or pricing
  </Card>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I set different limits for different athletes on same product?">
    **Short answer**: No (typically)

    **How product limits work**: Limits are set at product level, apply to ALL athletes who have that product

    **Workaround options**:

    1. **Create custom products for VIP athletes**
       - Example: "VIP 5x/Week Membership" for athlete who needs more
       - Manually assign at custom price
    2. **Use Master Credits for exceptions**
       - Athlete hits weekly limit on subscription
       - Grant Master Credits to supplement
    3. **Hybrid product strategy**
       - Base subscription with limits
       - Sell additional credit packs for overflow

    <Note>
      **Platform limitation**: Individual-athlete limit overrides are rare. Design products to fit 80% of use cases, handle exceptions manually.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I change limits on existing product?">
    **Effect**: Changes apply immediately to all athletes with that product

    **Example scenario**:

    - Product currently has 3 bookings/week limit
    - You change to 4 bookings/week
    - All athletes immediately can book 4/week going forward

    **Athlete notification**: System typically does NOT auto-notify athletes of limit changes

    **Your action required**:

    1. Email all athletes on product about change
    2. Update product description on website
    3. Post announcement in-app (if available)

    **Retroactive**: Changing limits does NOT affect past usage (can't "give back" usage from previous weeks)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes see their usage limits?">
    **Yes**: Athletes can view their usage in Athlete Portal

    **Location**: Athlete Portal ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Billing ‚Üí [Product Name]

    **What they see**:

    - Credit balance
    - Redeemable Sessions list
    - Usage: "2 of 3 weekly bookings used"
    - Reset date: "Resets Monday, Oct 7"

    **Benefit**: Self-service transparency reduces "Why can't I book?" questions

    <Tip>
      **Guide athletes**: During onboarding, show them where to check usage. "You can always see your weekly bookings used in Settings ‚Üí Billing"
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do Master Credits have usage limits?">
    **No**: Master Credits typically have NO usage limits (unless you manually configure)

    **Why**: Master Credits are designed as flexible override mechanism

    **Use case**:

    - Athlete hits weekly limit on subscription
    - You grant Master Credits as bonus/compensation
    - Athlete can use Master Credits even though subscription limit hit

    **Configuration option**: Some platforms allow setting limits on Master Credits, but this is rare and not recommended (defeats purpose of Master Credits)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use limits for finite credit packages?">
    **Generally no**: Finite packages are self-limiting (10 credits = maximum 10 sessions)

    **Exception scenarios where limits make sense**:

    1. **Program integrity**
       - 8-week program with 16 credits
       - Weekly limit: 2 bookings (enforces 2x/week structure)
       - Without limit: Athlete might book 8 sessions Week 1 (defeats program design)
    2. **Capacity protection**
       - Small group training with limited spots
       - Daily limit: 1 booking (prevents single athlete from booking multiple spots same day)
    3. **Expiration alignment**
       - 10-credit package expires in 5 weeks
       - Weekly limit: 2 bookings (paces usage to avoid last-minute rush)

    **Default recommendation**: No limits on standard finite packages (credit count is sufficient control)
