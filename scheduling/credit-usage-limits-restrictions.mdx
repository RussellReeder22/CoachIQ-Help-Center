## Understanding credit usage limits

Credit usage limits give you control over **how** and **where** athletes can redeem their credits. Without limits, athletes could potentially abuse unlimited subscriptions or use credits in ways that harm your business model.

### Why limits matter

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Business Protection">
    **Scenarios limits prevent:**

    ❌ Athlete with unlimited monthly credits books 30 sessions in one day\
    ❌ Athlete shares unlimited subscription with friends who book under their account\
    ❌ Athlete uses premium package credits for basic sessions (margin erosion)\
    ❌ Athlete books all high-demand time slots, blocking other paying athletes\
    ❌ Family shares one subscription across multiple people

    **Result without limits**: Revenue loss, capacity problems, unfair access distribution

    **Result with limits**: Predictable usage, fair access, protected margins
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Athlete Fairness">
    **Limits create fairness:**

    ✅ Prevents one athlete from monopolizing popular time slots\
    ✅ Ensures all subscription holders get equitable access\
    ✅ Maintains capacity for new athlete acquisition

    **Example**: Monthly unlimited subscription with "3 bookings per week" limit ensures athletes train consistently rather than booking 12 sessions in Week 1 and none in Weeks 2-4.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Business Model Alignment">
    **Limits align pricing with value:**

    ✅ Premium schedulers can require more credits (2 credits for advanced training)\
    ✅ Restrict basic package credits to basic schedulers only\
    ✅ Force high-value sessions to require premium subscriptions\
    ✅ Create clear product tiers with different access levels\
    ✅ Protect high-margin offerings

    **Example**: "\$200/month Youth Program" credits only work for youth schedulers, not your \$75/session private training.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Types of credit restrictions

CoachIQ offers multiple restriction mechanisms. Understanding each type helps you build the right control structure.

### Scheduler-specific restrictions

**What it does**: Limits which schedulers accept credits from a specific product/subscription

**How it works**: When creating a product, you select which schedulers can redeem these credits. Athletes can ONLY use these credits for designated schedulers.

**Example configuration:**

```
Product: "Rising Stars Youth Membership - $250/month"
Credits Issued: Unlimited (∞)
Redeemable Schedulers:
  ✓ Rising Stars Class
  ✓ Rising Stars Shooting Lab
  ✓ Rising Stars Open Gym
  ✗ Elite Training (not included)
  ✗ Private Sessions (not included)
```

**Athlete experience**: When booking "Elite Training," these credits won't show as payment option. They'll need Master Credits or direct payment.

<Tip>
  **Best practice**: Scheduler-specific restrictions are your FIRST line of defense. Always configure these when creating products.
</Tip>

---

### Multi-credit sessions

**What it does**: Makes certain schedulers cost MORE than 1 credit per booking

**How it works**: Configure scheduler to require 2, 3, or more credits per booking

**Use cases:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Premium Session Pricing">
    **Configuration**: Private training costs 2 credits, group class costs 1 credit

    **Business logic**:

    - Reflects higher value/cost of private sessions
    - Athlete with 10-credit package gets:
      - 10 group sessions OR
      - 5 private sessions OR
      - Mix (e.g., 6 group + 2 private = 10 credits)

    **Benefit**: Single package serves multiple session types with appropriate pricing

    **Example**:

    ```
    Package: "10-Credit Flex Package - $450"
    Session Types:
      - Group Training: 1 credit ($45 value)
      - Semi-Private (2 people): 1.5 credits ($67.50 value)
      - Private Training: 2 credits ($90 value)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Longer Session Duration">
    **Configuration**: 30-min session = 1 credit, 60-min session = 2 credits

    **Business logic**: Time-proportional pricing

    **Athlete choice**: Pick session length based on credit availability and goals

    **Example**:

    ```
    Scheduler Options:
      - 30-Min Quick Hit: 1 credit
      - 60-Min Full Training: 2 credits
      - 90-Min Extended Session: 3 credits
    ```

    **Flexibility**: Athlete with 5 credits could book 5×30min OR 2×60min + 1×30min
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specialty Services">
    **Configuration**: Standard training = 1 credit, video analysis session = 3 credits

    **Business logic**: Reflects additional coach prep time, technology costs, expertise

    **Use case**:

    - Video analysis requires 30min filming + 60min review + editing
    - Costs you more time/resources than standard session
    - 3 credits = appropriate compensation

    **Athlete perception**: Specialty service is premium offering (higher credit cost signals higher value)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Keep it simple**: Most coaches should stick to 1-2 credit variations max. Complex multi-credit systems confuse athletes and complicate booking.
</Warning>

## Configuring scheduler-specific restrictions within Product

Step-by-step: Limiting credits to specific schedulers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to product builder">
    Dashboard → **Payments** → **Products** → Select product → **Edit**

    Or: Create new product and continue to credit configuration section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll to Credit Limits section">
    You'll see several configuration options:

    - **Add credits once purchased**: Number of credits issued (or ∞ for unlimited)
    - **Credit expiration options**: Carry over vs expire
    - **Redeemable Schedulers**: 🎯 THIS IS WHERE YOU SET RESTRICTIONS

    <Frame>
      ![Credit Limits configuration in product builder](/credit-limits-product.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Redeemable Schedulers">
    Click **Select Schedulers** or similar button

    **You'll see**:

    - List of all your active schedulers
    - Checkboxes next to each scheduler
    - Search/filter options (if many schedulers)

    **Action**: Check ONLY the schedulers where these credits should work

    <Tip>
      **Strategic thinking**: Leave unchecked = credits won't work there (athlete will need Master Credits or direct payment)
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure scheduler-level details (if available)">
    Some products allow per-scheduler limits:

    **Example**:

    ```
    Rising Stars Membership - Redeemable Schedulers:
      ✓ Rising Stars Class (Unlimited bookings)
      ✓ Rising Stars Shooting Lab (Max 2/week)
      ✓ Rising Stars Open Gym (Max 4/month)
    ```

    **Configuration**: Click scheduler to expand advanced settings

    **Set**: Daily, weekly, or monthly limits per scheduler
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    Click **Save** or **Update Product**

    **Verification checklist**:

    1. Product shows selected schedulers in "Redeemable Schedulers" section
    2. Athlete profile shows these schedulers under product's credit tab
    3. Test booking: Athlete can book selected schedulers, blocked from others

    <Check>
      **Success!** Credits are now restricted to designated schedulers only.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Configuring multi-credit sessions

Making certain schedulers cost multiple credits per booking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to scheduler settings">
    Dashboard → **Schedule** → **Schedulers** → Select scheduler → **Settings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find payment/pricing section">
    Scroll to "Payment Options" or "Pricing" section

    You'll see options for:

    - Free
    - Direct Payment (\$ amount)
    - Credit Charge ← THIS IS WHERE YOU CONFIGURE

    <Frame>
      ![Scheduler payment configuration](/credit-charge-ui.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set credit cost">
    **Look for**: "Credits Price" field

    **Configuration options**:

    - **1 credit** (default/standard)
    - **2 credits** (common for premium)
    - **3+ credits** (specialty/extended sessions)

    **Select**: Number of credits this scheduler requires per booking

    <Note>
      **Recommendation**: Stick to whole numbers (1, 2, 3) for simplicity. Fractional credits (0.5, 1.5) work but confuse some athletes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure hybrid payment (optional)">
    If you want to offer BOTH credit AND direct payment options:

    **Example**: "2 Credits OR \$90"

    **Configuration**:

    - Credits required: 2
    - Direct payment amount: \$90
    - Enable both options

    **Athlete choice**: At booking, athlete chooses payment method (use 2 credits OR pay \$90)

    <Tip>
      **Strategic pricing**: Price direct payment higher than credit-equivalent to incentivize package purchases.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    **Save** scheduler settings

    **Test**:

    1. Athlete with credits attempts to book
    2. System should deduct 2 credits (or configured amount)
    3. Credit logs should show: "-2 Credits | Redeemed for [Scheduler Name]"
    4. Athlete's balance decreases by 2

    <Check>
      **Success!** Scheduler now costs multiple credits per booking.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding limit interactions

How different limits work together (and sometimes conflict).

### Limit priority hierarchy

When multiple limits exist, this is the order CoachIQ enforces:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Scheduler-specific restrictions (highest priority)">
    **Question**: Can this product's credits even be used for this scheduler?

    **Check**: Is scheduler in product's "Redeemable Schedulers" list?

    **If NO**: Booking blocked entirely (other limits don't matter)

    **If YES**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Credit balance check">
    **Question**: Does athlete have enough credits?

    **Check**: Athlete's credit balance ≥ scheduler's credit cost?

    **If NO**: Booking blocked (athlete needs more credits)

    **If YES**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Usage frequency limits">
    **Question**: Has athlete hit daily/weekly/monthly booking limit?

    **Check**: Current bookings vs limit for this product

    **If limit reached**: Booking blocked (athlete must wait for reset)

    **If under limit**: Continue to next check
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Scheduler capacity">
    **Question**: Is there room in the session?

    **Check**: Current bookings vs max capacity

    **If full**: Booking blocked (session full)

    **If space available**: ✅ **Booking allowed**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example limit interaction scenarios

## Viewing athlete usage limits

Where coaches see limit consumption.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to athlete profile">
    Dashboard → **People** → **Clients** → [Athlete Name]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Credits section">
    Click **Credits** tab or section in athlete profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select product-specific tab">
    Click the tab for the subscription/product with usage limits configured

    **Example**: "Month to Month Rising Stars Membership"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Redeemable Schedulers Log">
    Look for "Redeemable Schedulers" section

    <Frame>
      ![Usage limits tracking in athlete profile](/credit-log-ui.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review usage data">
    **What you'll see**:

    - **Redeemable Schedulers**: List of schedulers credits can be redeemed for
    - **Limits for each Scheduler: **Number sessions redeemed over the limit that can be redeemed for the billing cycle.

    **Use this to**:

    - Verify athlete is under/at limits
    - Troubleshoot "can't book" complaints
    - Monitor if limits are too restrictive or too loose
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Weekly monitoring**: Review top users weekly. If many athletes consistently hit limits, consider adjusting (limits may be too restrictive). If no one hits limits, they may be too generous.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting limit issues

When limits aren't working as expected.

### Issue: Athlete reports they can't book but haven't hit limit

**Diagnostic steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify limit status">
    Athlete Profile → Credits → [Product Tab] → Redeemable Schedulers Log

    **Check**:

    - Corresponding scheduler is listed
    - Per-scheduler bookings: X of Y used

    **If no issues found**: Continue troubleshooting
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check scheduler restrictions">
    **Verify**: Is the scheduler athlete is trying to book in product's "Redeemable Schedulers" list?

    **How to check**:

    1. Payments → Products → [Product] → Redeemable Schedulers section
    2. Look for scheduler name
    3. If NOT listed → That's the problem (scheduler restriction blocking)

    **Solution**: Either add scheduler to redeemable list OR athlete needs different credit type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify credit balance">
    **Check**: Does athlete have enough credits for this scheduler's cost?

    **Example issue**:

    - Scheduler requires 2 credits
    - Athlete has 1 credit remaining
    - System blocks booking (insufficient credits)

    **Solution**: Athlete needs to purchase more credits or use Master Credits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check subscription status on Stripe">
    If subscription credits:

    **Verify**: Payments → Subscriptions → Is subscription "Active" on Stripe?

    **If inactive**: Credits become unusable even if balance exists

    **Solution**: Athlete must resolve payment issue to reactivate subscription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test booking yourself">
    **As coach**:

    1. Navigate to Calendar
    2. Manually book athlete into session
    3. If booking succeeds: Issue is app/athlete-side
    4. If booking fails: You'll see the actual error message

    **Common discoveries**:

    - Session is full (capacity issue, not limit issue)
    - Athlete has conflicting booking
    - Time slot outside scheduling window
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices for setting limits

Strategic guidance for different scenarios.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Conservative" icon="shield">
    **Principle**: Easier to loosen limits than tighten them

    **Approach**:

    - Launch new unlimited product with 3/week limit
    - Monitor usage for 60 days
    - If 20% hit limits, consider increasing to 4/week
    - If 40% hit limits, limits may be too tight

    **Why**: Increasing limits feels like a gift to athletes. Decreasing limits feels like taking away value (negative sentiment).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Align Limits with Marketing" icon="bullseye">
    **Principle**: What you advertise should match what limits allow

    **Examples**:

    - ✅ "3x/Week Training" + 3 bookings/week limit
    - ✅ "Unlimited Classes (up to 4/week)" + 4 bookings/week limit
    - ❌ "Unlimited Training" + 3 bookings/week limit (misleading)

    **Why**: Truth in advertising prevents athlete frustration and legal issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Limits for Product Differentiation" icon="layer-group">
    **Principle**: Limits define product tiers

    **Example structure**:

    - **Basic**: 2 bookings/week, \$200/month
    - **Standard**: 3 bookings/week, \$300/month
    - **Premium**: 5 bookings/week, \$450/month

    **Why**: Clear value progression encourages upgrades
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor and Iterate" icon="chart-line">
    **Principle**: Limits aren't set-it-and-forget-it

    **Quarterly review**:

    - What % of athletes hit each limit type?
    - Are hit rates increasing or decreasing over time?
    - What's average usage vs limit?
    - Any athlete complaints or confusion?

    **Adjust**: Based on data, not individual complaints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate Limits Clearly" icon="comment-alt">
    **Principle**: No surprises

    **Where to communicate**:

    - Product name: "3x/Week Membership"
    - Product description: "Train up to 3 times per week"
    - Checkout page: "Includes 3 sessions per week"
    - Confirmation email: "You can book 3 sessions per week"
    - In-app display: "2/3 weekly bookings used"

    **Why**: Informed athletes are satisfied athletes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balance Business + Athlete Needs" icon="balance-scale">
    **Principle**: Limits should protect business WITHOUT frustrating athletes

    **Sweet spot**:

    - 80% of athletes never hit limits (limits are fair)
    - 15% occasionally hit limits (acceptable constraint)
    - 5% frequently hit limits (should upgrade to higher tier)

    **If different**: Adjust limits or pricing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I set different limits for different athletes on same product?">
    **Short answer**: No (typically)

    **How product limits work**: Limits are set at product level, apply to ALL athletes who have that product

    **Workaround options**:

    1. **Create custom products for VIP athletes**
       - Example: "VIP 5x/Week Membership" for athlete who needs more
       - Manually assign at custom price
    2. **Use Master Credits for exceptions**
       - Athlete hits weekly limit on subscription
       - Grant Master Credits to supplement
    3. **Hybrid product strategy**
       - Base subscription with limits
       - Sell additional credit packs for overflow

    <Note>
      **Platform limitation**: Individual-athlete limit overrides are rare. Design products to fit 80% of use cases, handle exceptions manually.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I change limits on existing product?">
    **Effect**: Changes apply immediately to all athletes with that product

    **Example scenario**:

    - Product currently has 3 bookings/week limit
    - You change to 4 bookings/week
    - All athletes immediately can book 4/week going forward

    **Athlete notification**: System  does NOT auto-notify athletes of limit changes

    **Your action required**:

    1. Email all athletes on product about change
    2. Update product description on website
    3. Post announcement in-app (if available)

    **Retroactive**: Changing limits does NOT affect past usage (can't "give back" usage from previous weeks)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can athletes see their usage limits?">
    **Yes**: Athletes can view their usage in Athlete Portal

    **Location**: Athlete Portal → Settings → Billing

    **What they see**:

    - Credit balance
    - Redeemable Sessions list
    - Usage: "2 of 3 weekly bookings used"
    - Reset date: "Resets Monday, Oct 7"

    **Benefit**: Self-service transparency reduces "Why can't I book?" questions

    <Tip>
      **Guide athletes**: During onboarding, show them where to check usage. "You can always see your weekly bookings used in Settings → Billing"
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do Master Credits have usage limits?">
    **No**: Master Credits typically have NO usage limits (unless you manually configure)

    **Why**: Master Credits are designed as flexible override mechanism

    **Use case**:

    - Athlete hits weekly limit on subscription
    - You grant Master Credits as bonus/compensation
    - Athlete can use Master Credits even though subscription limit hit

    **Configuration option**: Some platforms allow setting limits on Master Credits, but this is rare and not recommended (defeats purpose of Master Credits)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use limits for finite credit packages?">
    **Generally no**: Finite packages are self-limiting (10 credits = maximum 10 sessions)

    **Exception scenarios where limits make sense**:

    1. **Program integrity**
       - 8-week program with 16 credits
       - Weekly limit: 2 bookings (enforces 2x/week structure)
       - Without limit: Athlete might book 8 sessions Week 1 (defeats program design)
    2. **Capacity protection**
       - Small group training with limited spots
       - Daily limit: 1 booking (prevents single athlete from booking multiple spots same day)
    3. **Expiration alignment**
       - 10-credit package expires in 5 weeks
       - Weekly limit: 2 bookings (paces usage to avoid last-minute rush)

    **Default recommendation**: No limits on standard finite packages (credit count is sufficient control)
  </Accordion>
