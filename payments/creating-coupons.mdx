## Before you create a coupon

Decide on these details first:

**Code name**: What clients will type (SPRING25, SAVE10, FREESESSION)

**Discount type**: Free, percentage off, or dollar amount off

**Discount value**: 10%, 25%, 50%, or $10, $25, \$50, etc.

**Usage limits**: Unlimited or specific number of redemptions

**Duration**: Permanent or expiration date

## Create a coupon

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Coupons">
    Click **Payments → Coupons** in the left sidebar.

    <Frame>
      ![Navigate to Coupons page](/images/payments/navigate-to-coupons.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Coupon">
    Click the blue **\+ Create Coupon** button in the top right.

    <Frame>
      ![Create Coupon button location](/images/payments/create-coupon-button.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose coupon type">
    Select one:

    - **Free** (100% off)
    - **Percentage Off** (10%, 25%, 50%, etc.)
    - **Amount Off** ($10, $25, \$50, etc.)

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Free">
        Makes products completely free. No payment collected.

        **Best for:** Giveaways, scholarships, promotional trials
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Percentage Off">
        Reduces price by percentage. Works with any product price.

        **Best for:** Sales, referral rewards, member discounts
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Amount Off">
        Reduces price by fixed dollar amount.

        **Best for:** Bundle discounts, retention offers, fixed promotions
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter coupon code">
    **Field: Coupon Code**

    The exact text clients must type at checkout.

    **Requirements:**

    - Letters, numbers, and hyphens only
    - No spaces
    - Case sensitive (SAVE10 ≠ save10)
    - Must be unique

    **Best practices:**

    - Keep it short (under 15 characters)
    - Make it memorable
    - Include discount if possible (25OFF, SAVE50)
    - Avoid confusing characters (0/O, 1/l)

    <Frame>
      ![Coupon code input field](/images/payments/coupon-code-field.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      **Good codes:** SPRING25, REFER20, WELCOME, SAVE50

      **Bad codes:** xJ7h2K9, coupon123, thisisalongcouponcode
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set discount value">
    **For Percentage Off:** Enter percentage (10, 25, 50, etc.)

    Client pays: Original price × (1 - percentage/100)

    Example: $100 product with 25% off = $75

    **For Amount Off:** Enter dollar amount ($10, $25, \$50, etc.)

    Client pays: Original price - discount amount

    Example: $100 product with $25 off = \$75

    <Warning>
      Amount-off coupons cannot reduce price below $0. $50 off a $30 product results in $0 charge, not -\$20.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure redemption limits (optional)">
    **Field: Redemption Limit**

    Control how many times this coupon can be used.

    **Options:**

    - **Unlimited** (default) - No limit on uses
    - **Limited** - Set specific number (50, 100, 500, etc.)

    <Info>
      Redemption counter increases each time coupon is used. Coupon stops working after limit reached.
    </Info>
    <Frame>
      ![Redemption limit configuration](/images/payments/redemption-limit-field.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set expiration date (optional)">
    **Field: Expires On**

    When coupon automatically deactivates.

    **Options:**

    - **No expiration** (default) - Works indefinitely
    - **Specific date** - Calendar picker to select end date

    <Tip>
      Limited-time offers create urgency. Set expiration 1-4 weeks out for promotional campaigns.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save coupon">
    Click **Create Coupon** or **Save**.

## Common coupon creation mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code is too complex or confusing">
    **Problem:** xK7J2mP9 is hard to remember and type correctly.

    **Fix:** Use simple, memorable codes like SPRING25 or SAVE10.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Percentage vs. amount confusion">
    **Problem:** Created 25% off but meant \$25 off (or vice versa).

    **Fix:** Double-check coupon type before saving. Test before promoting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Case sensitivity issues">
    **Problem:** Client types "save10" but code is "SAVE10" (doesn't work).

    **Fix:** Use all uppercase codes and communicate them in uppercase. Remind clients to match case.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No expiration or limits on limited campaign">
    **Problem:** Meant to run 1-week sale but forgot to set expiration. Coupon still active months later.

    **Fix:** Always set expiration for limited-time offers. Set redemption limits for controlled campaigns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Didn't test before promoting">
    **Problem:** Shared coupon code publicly but it doesn't work or applies wrong discount.

    **Fix:** Test every coupon in Stripe Test Mode before announcing to clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
