- Client enters payment details
- Purchase completes
- No password or profile created

**With guest checkout disabled (default):**

- Client must create CoachIQ account
- Account required before checkout
- Client gets Athlete Portal access

</Note>

## Converting guests to clients

**If guest wants to book sessions later:**

They must create account separately:

1. Guest visits your booking page
2. Clicks "Sign Up" or "Create Account"
3. Creates account with email (same email as guest purchase)
4. Now can book sessions and access portal

<Info>
  Creating account after guest purchase doesn't automatically link past guest transactions. They're separate.
</Info>

## Limitations of guest checkout

</Warning>

## Best practices

**Use guest checkout for:**

- Products sold to general public
- One-time purchases with no follow-up
- Merchandise or physical goods
- Events open to non-clients

**Don't use guest checkout for:**

- Core coaching services
- Anything requiring credits
- Subscriptions or memberships
- Session bookings

**Consider hybrid approach:**

- Enable guest checkout on merchandise products
- Disable guest checkout on session products
- Let clients choose which products allow guests

<Tip>
  Most coaches disable guest checkout on primary coaching products. Enable only for specific public-facing offerings.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Guest checkout enabled but clients still must create account">
    **Check:**

    - Product has guest checkout toggled ON
    - Product is published (not draft)
    - Browser cache cleared

    If still requiring account, contact support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guest purchased but can't access program content">
    **This is expected behavior.**

    Guest checkout doesn't grant portal access. Guests can't access programs even if they purchased.

    **Solutions:**

    - Disable guest checkout for program products
    - Require account creation for program access
    - Guest must create account separately to access content
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Want to find guest's purchase">
    **Check Transactions page:**

    - Search by email address
    - Look for transaction date
    - Guest purchases labeled with email, not client name

    Guest won't appear in client list - only in transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guest wants to book session but didn't create account">
    **Guest must create account to book:**

    Direct them to:

    1. Your booking page
    2. "Sign Up" or "Create Account"
    3. Use same email from guest purchase
    4. Now can book sessions

    Previous guest purchase won't automatically link to new account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Refunds for guest purchases

**Process same as regular refunds:**

1. Find transaction in Transactions page
2. Click transaction
3. Issue refund

**Guest notification:**

- Refund confirmation sent to email
- Money returns to original payment method
- Guest doesn't need account to receive refund
