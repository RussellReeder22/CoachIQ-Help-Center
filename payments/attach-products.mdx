<Info>
**Three places to use products**: Session schedulers, programs, and forms
</Info>

## Where products attach

Products don't generate revenue until attached to something clients interact with:

**Session Schedulers** → Clients book time slots and pay
**Programs** → Clients purchase access to locked content
**Forms** → Clients submit forms with payment

One product can attach to multiple places. Reuse products across your offerings.

You can attach multiple products to schedulers and forms (but not programs).

- $75 Single Session
- $650 for 10-Session Package
- $200/month Unlimited Membership

Client chooses which option works best for them during booking.

## Detaching or changing products

**To remove a product from scheduler:**
1. Open scheduler payment settings
2. Click X next to product name
3. Save scheduler

**To swap products:**
1. Remove old product
2. Add new product
3. Save scheduler

<Warning>
Detaching a product doesn't affect existing bookings or purchases. It only prevents new purchases.
</Warning>

## Products vs. credits vs. free

Understanding when to use each payment method:

**Free** - No payment required
- Use for: Complimentary sessions, internal team use, evaluation sessions

**Product** - Direct purchase required, no credits accepted
- Use for: When you don't want to manage credit system, single-purchase offerings

**Credits** - Must have credits, no direct purchase option
- Use for: When you only want existing clients/members to book (no new purchases)

**Product OR Credits** - Client chooses payment method or uses credits
- Use for: Maximum flexibility, most common setup

<Tip>
**Recommended:** Use Product OR Credits for most schedulers. Gives clients choice while allowing new purchases.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Product doesn't appear in dropdown">
**Check these:**
- Product is published (not draft)
- Product isn't archived
- You're looking in correct section (schedulers vs programs vs forms)
- Refresh the page

If still missing, go to Payments → Products and verify product status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client says they can't book">
**Verify:**
- Product is attached to scheduler
- Product price is correct (not accidentally $0 or $10,000)
- Stripe is connected and in Live Mode
- Client has valid payment method

Test the booking flow yourself to identify where it breaks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Credits aren't working">
Credits require configuration in both Products AND Schedule sections.

**Check:**
- Product has credits enabled
- Number of credits is specified
- Scheduler payment method includes "Credits" option
- Scheduler is in the product's allowed usage list

[Learn more about credits →](/payments/credits-and-products)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Want to require membership before booking">
Set scheduler payment method to **Credits** only.

Then only clients with active membership subscriptions (which issue credits) can book.

This prevents one-off purchases and ensures only members access these sessions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
