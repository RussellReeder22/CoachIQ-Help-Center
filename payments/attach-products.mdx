<Info>
  **Three places to use products**: Session schedulers, programs, and forms
</Info>

## Where products attach

Products don't generate revenue until attached to something clients interact with:

**Session Schedulers** → Clients book time slots and pay **Programs** → Clients purchase access to locked content **Forms** → Clients submit forms with payment

One product can attach to multiple places. Reuse products across your offerings.

## Attach products to session schedulers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to scheduler payment settings">
    1. Go to **Schedule** in left sidebar
    2. Click **Schedulers**
    3. Select the scheduler you want to add payment to

    **Product** - Client must purchase a product to book

    **Credits** - Client must have credits to book (no direct payment)

    **Product OR Credits** - Client can either buy product or use existing credits

    <Tip>
      **Most common:** Product OR Credits. Gives clients flexibility to pay directly or use credits from packages.

## Paywall vs. credits vs. free

Understanding when to use each payment method:

**Free** - No payment required

- Use for: Complimentary sessions, internal team use, evaluation sessions

**Paywall** \*\*Only \*\*- Direct purchase required, no credits accepted

- Use for: When you don't want to manage credit system, single-purchase offerings

**Credits** - Must have credits, no direct purchase option

- Use for: When you only want existing clients/members to book (no new purchases)

**Paywall OR Credits** - Client chooses payment method or uses credits

- Use for: Maximum flexibility, most common setup

<Tip>
  **Recommended:** Use Paywall OR Credits for most schedulers. Gives clients choice while allowing new purchases.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Product doesn't appear in dropdown">
    **Check these:**

    - Product is published (not draft)
    - Product isn't archived
    - You're looking in correct section (schedulers vs programs vs forms)
    - Refresh the page

    If still missing, go to Payments → Products and verify product status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client says they can't book">
    **Verify:**

    - Product is attached to scheduler
    - Product price is correct (not accidentally $0 or $10,000)
    - Stripe is connected and in Live Mode
    - Client has valid payment method

    Test the booking flow yourself to identify where it breaks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credits aren't working">
    Credits require configuration in both Products AND Schedule sections.

    **Check:**

    - Product has credits enabled
    - Number of credits is specified
    - Scheduler payment method includes "Credits" option
    - Scheduler is in the product's allowed usage list

    [Learn more about credits →](/payments/credits-and-products)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Want to require membership before booking">
    Set scheduler payment method to **Credits** only.

    Then only clients with active membership subscriptions (which issue credits) can book.

    This prevents one-off purchases and ensures only members access these sessions.
  </Accordion>
