## After creating your product

Your product exists but clients can't purchase it yet. Next steps:

1. **Attach to scheduler**: Enable payment for session bookings
   - Schedule → Schedulers → [Select Scheduler] → Payment Settings
   - [Learn how →](/payments/products-integration)
2. **Add to program**: Paywall content behind purchase
   - Content → Programs → [Select Program] → Paywall
   - [Learn how →](/payments/products-integration)
3. **Include in form**: Collect payment during form submission
   - Tools → Forms → Form Builder → Add Payment Field
   - [Learn how →](/payments/products-integration)

<Warning>
  Products don't generate revenue until attached to a scheduler, program, or form.
</Warning>

## Common first product mistakes

**Price is wrong**: Double-check your price. It's easy to accidentally type $5.00 instead of $50.00. Preview your product before publishing.

**Missing description**: Clients see a blank checkout page if you skip the description. Add at least one sentence explaining what they're buying.

**Credits without scheduler setup**: Creating a product with credits doesn't automatically enable credit bookings. You must also configure credit settings in your schedulers.

**Test mode vs. live mode**: If Stripe is in Test Mode, your product only accepts test cards. Switch to Live Mode in Stripe when ready for real payments.
