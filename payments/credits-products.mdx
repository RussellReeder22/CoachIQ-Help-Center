  **Where to configure credits**: Payments → Products → [Product] → Section 3 (Credits)
</Info>

## What credits are

Credits are pre-purchased session bookings that work like punch cards or class passes.

**How it works:**

1. Client buys a product that includes credits
2. Credits appear in their account
3. Client uses credits to book sessions
4. Credit count decreases with each booking

Credits let clients pay upfront for multiple sessions instead of paying per booking.

## Credits are configured in products

Enable credits when creating or editing a product:

**Product Builder → Section 3: Credits**

- Toggle credits ON
- Specify number of credits (e.g., 10 credits)
- Set expiration (30 days, 90 days, never, etc.)
- Choose which schedulers accept these credits (Section 4)

<Note>
  Credits are optional. Not every product needs to issue credits. Many coaches use products for payment-only without credit systems.
</Note>

## Two types of credits

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Master Credits">
    **Can be used for any session**

    - No scheduler restrictions
    - Maximum flexibility for clients
    - Most common type

    **Configure:**

    - Leave "Usage Limits" blank in Product Builder
    - Or select all schedulers

    **Example:** "10-Session Package" with Master Credits works for any session type you offer.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Product-Specific Credits">
    **Restricted to certain schedulers**

    - Work only for designated session types
    - Prevent credits from being used incorrectly
    - Better for specialized packages

    **Configure:**

    - Select specific schedulers in "Usage Limits" section

    **Example:** "Youth Training Package" credits only work for youth sessions, not adult sessions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Credit notation

Credits display with special notation in client profiles:

**Basic format:**

- `5` = 5 credits available
- `0` = No credits remaining
- `∞` = Unlimited credits

**Product-specific format:**

- `3/∞ Rising Stars` = 3 of unlimited credits for "Rising Stars" scheduler
- `5/10 Youth Training` = 5 of 10 credits for "Youth Training" scheduler

<Info>
  This notation appears in client profiles under the Credits tab and during booking flows.
</Info>

## How clients use credits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Client purchases product with credits">
    Client buys "10-Session Package" for \$650. Receives 10 credits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Client books session">
    Client goes to booking page and selects session type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment screen shows credit option">
    Instead of paying, client sees "Use 1 Credit" option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Client selects use credits">
    Client clicks "Use Credits & Book". Credit count decreases by 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session confirmed">
    Booking confirmed without payment. Client now has 9 credits remaining.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Credit management happens in Schedule section

While credits are **configured** in Products, they're **managed** in the Schedule section:

**For complete credit documentation, see:**

- Viewing client credit balances
- Manually adding or removing credits
- Credit expiration tracking
- Credit usage reports
- Troubleshooting credit issues

<Note>
  **Important:** This Payments section covers credit configuration in products only. For viewing balances, manual adjustments, usage tracking, and troubleshooting, see the Schedule section of the help center.
</Note>

  <Tab title="Simple session package">
    **10-Session Package**

    **Product setup:**

    - Type: One-Time
    - Price: \$650
    - Credits: 10
    - Expiration: 90 days

    **Unlimited Monthly Training**

    **Product setup:**

    - Type: Subscription
    - Price: \$200/month

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specialized package">
    **Youth Training Package**

    **Product setup:**

    - Type: One-Time
    - Price: \$500
    - Credits: 8

    - Usage: Youth Training scheduler only

    Client pays \$500, gets 8 sessions but can only book youth training sessions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Credits vs. direct payment

**With credits:**

- Client pays upfront for multiple sessions
- Reduces friction at booking time
- Encourages package purchases
- Creates commitment to training

**Without credits (payment-only products):**

- Client pays per booking
- No credit tracking needed
- Simpler system if you don't want credit management

<Tip>
  Many coaches offer both: single-session products (no credits) and package products (with credits). Gives clients choice.
</Tip>

## Key points about credits

**Credits are product-based:** Enable credits in Product Builder when creating products

**Optional feature:** Not required. Many products don't use credits at all

**Expiration matters:** Set realistic expiration dates. Too short frustrates clients, too long reduces urgency

**Subscription credits renew:** Subscription products issue new credits each billing period

**Master vs. restricted:** Choose based on whether you want maximum flexibility or controlled usage

**Management lives elsewhere:** View balances, make adjustments, and troubleshoot in Schedule section

## When NOT to use credits

**Skip credits if:**

- You only offer single sessions (direct payment is simpler)
- You don't want to track credit balances
- Your pricing is too variable for packages
- You prefer pay-per-session model

Credits add complexity. Only use them if packages benefit your business model.
