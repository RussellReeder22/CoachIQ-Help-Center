## What the Subscriptions page shows

The Subscriptions dashboard displays all recurring billing for your coaching business:

- Active memberships and their status
- Canceled subscriptions
- Failed payment retries
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Subscription history and details

Every subscription product purchase creates an entry here that tracks billing until canceled.

## Key metrics at the top

Three metrics display above your subscription list:

**Active Subscriptions**
- Count of currently active, billing subscriptions
- Includes trialing and scheduled subscriptions
- Excludes canceled and past due

**Canceled Subscriptions**
- Total number of ended subscriptions
- Tracks churn and cancellation history

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
- Total monthly revenue from active subscriptions
- Updates in real-time as subscriptions change
- Based on monthly equivalent (annual subscriptions divided by 12)

<Tip>
MRR is your most important subscription metric. Track this to measure subscription business health.
