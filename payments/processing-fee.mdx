## What processing fees are

Every successful transaction through Stripe incurs fees:

**US standard rates:**

- 2.9% of transaction amount
- Plus \$0.30 per transaction

**Example:**

- \$100 charge
- Stripe fee: (100 × 0.029) + 0.30 = \$3.20
- You receive: \$96.80

<Note>
  Fees set by Stripe, not CoachIQ. International cards and currency conversions may have additional fees.
</Note>

## Who pays the fees

You decide who covers Stripe's processing fees:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="You absorb fees">
    **Default option - You pay the fees**

    Client pays product price. You receive product price minus Stripe fees.

    **Example:**

    - Product price: \$100
    - Client pays: \$100
    - Stripe fee: \$3.20
    - You receive: \$96.80

    **Pros:**

    - Simpler pricing
    - Better client experience
    - Standard industry practice

    **Cons:**

    - Reduces your revenue per sale
    - Fees add up over time
    - You lose 2.9%+ on every sale
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Client pays fees">
    **Pass fees to client**

    Stripe fees added as separate line item at checkout. You receive full product price.

    **Example:**

    - Product price: \$100
    - Stripe fee: \$3.20
    - Client pays: \$103.20
    - You receive: \$100.00

    **Pros:**

    - You receive full product price
    - No revenue lost to fees
    - More accurate pricing

    **Cons:**

    - Higher price may reduce conversions
    - Adds complexity at checkout
    - Some clients resistant to fees
    - State regulations may restrict this

    <Warning>
      Some US states restrict credit card surcharges. Check local laws before passing fees to clients.

## Calculating fee amounts

**Stripe's standard formula:**

Fee = (Transaction amount × 0.029) + \$0.30

**Examples:**

| Product Price | Stripe Fee | You Absorb       | Client Pays          |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| \$50          | \$1.75     | You get \$48.25  | Client pays \$51.75  |
| \$100         | \$3.20     | You get \$96.80  | Client pays \$103.20 |
| \$200         | \$6.10     | You get \$193.90 | Client pays \$206.10 |
| \$500         | \$14.80    | You get \$485.20 | Client pays \$514.80 |

<Note>
  These calculations use 2.9% + \$0.30. Your actual rates may differ based on your Stripe account.
</Note>

## Custom fee structures

Some coaches configure custom fee amounts:

**Higher than Stripe fees:**

- Cover additional costs (bookkeeping, software)
- Flat \$5 processing fee instead of calculated amount
- Markup percentage (3.5% instead of 2.9%)

**Lower than Stripe fees:**

- Split costs with client (1.5% + \$0.15 each)
- Absorb fixed fee, pass percentage only
- Subsidize to reduce client price impact

<Warning>
  Be transparent about fees. Unexpected charges damage trust and may violate consumer protection laws in some areas.
</Warning>

## Legal considerations

**Before passing fees to clients, check:**

**State regulations:**

- Some states prohibit credit card surcharges
- Others require specific disclosures
- Rules vary by location

**Stripe's terms:**

- Must comply with Stripe's surcharging requirements
- Proper labeling required
- Card brand rules apply

**Disclosure requirements:**

- Must inform clients before purchase
- Can't hide fees in fine print
- Clear explanation of what fee covers

<Warning>
  Consult legal counsel about surcharging regulations in your jurisdiction before implementing.
</Warning>

## Impact on pricing strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Absorb fees - Price higher">
    **Build fees into your base price**

    If you absorb fees, increase base price to maintain margins:

    - Target: \$100 profit per session
    - Stripe fee: ~3%
    - Set price: \$103 + to net \$100

    Client sees: \$103 (clean price)You receive: ~\$100 after fees
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pass fees - Price lower">
    **Price products at target, add fees**

    If clients pay fees, price at exact target:

    - Target: \$100 profit per session
    - Set price: \$100
    - Fee added: ~\$3.20

    Client sees: $100 + $3.20 fee = $103.20
You receive: $100
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Result:** Similar final cost to client either way. Choose based on market expectations and legal compliance.

## International and special fees

**Additional Stripe fees may apply for:**

**International cards:**

- Additional 1% for non-US cards
- Configure: 3.9% + \$0.30 for international

**Currency conversion:**

- Additional 1% for currency conversion
- Applies when charge currency differs from payout currency

**Disputed charges:**

- \$15 chargeback fee
- Separate from processing fees
- Usually not passed to clients

<Note>
  Most coaches use standard 2.9% + \$0.30 for US cards and absorb international card fees rather than configuring multiple fee structures.
</Note>

## Changing fee configuration

**Existing products:**

- Edit product → Section 2 → Update processing fee settings
- Changes apply to future purchases only
- Doesn't affect past transactions

**Active subscriptions:**

- Fee configuration locked at subscription creation
- Can't change mid-subscription
- Applies to new subscriptions only

<Warning>
  Changing who pays fees mid-campaign may confuse clients. Communicate changes clearly.
</Warning>
