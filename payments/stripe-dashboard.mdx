## Test mode vs. live mode

Stripe Dashboard has two modes:

**Test Mode**: Use fake card numbers to test payment flows without real money. Toggle Test Mode on to safely experiment with products, subscriptions, and refunds.

**Live Mode**: Real payments with real money. This is your production environment where actual client transactions occur.

<Info>
  The toggle switch is in the top right of your Stripe Dashboard. CoachIQ automatically reflects whichever mode Stripe is in.
</Info>

## Understanding your balance

Your Stripe balance has two states:

**Pending**: Money from recent payments that's still processing. Typically holds for 2 business days before becoming available.

**Available**: Money ready to pay out to your bank account. Stripe automatically deposits available funds based on your payout schedule.

<Note>
  Your first payout takes 7-10 business days after your first successful payment. This initial delay is standard for new accounts.
</Note>
