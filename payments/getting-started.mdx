## What CoachIQ Payments does

CoachIQ Payments handles all revenue operations for your coaching business:

**Direct purchase**
Client books session → Selects time → Pays with card → Confirmed

**Subscription billing**
Client subscribes → Card charged monthly → Receives credits/access automatically

**Access code**
Client enters code → Discount applied (or free) → Access granted

## Payment processing fees

Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 per successful transaction (US rates). You can configure products to either:
- Absorb the fee (you receive less)
- Pass to customer (they pay slightly more)

<Note>
Fees are set by Stripe, not CoachIQ. International rates and currency conversions may differ.
</Note>

## What you need to know

**Stripe handles everything**: CoachIQ doesn't store card numbers or process payments directly. Stripe manages all payment security, PCI compliance, and fraud prevention.

**Automatic reconciliation**: Every transaction in CoachIQ syncs with Stripe in real-time. Your records always match.

**Bank deposits**: Stripe deposits funds to your bank account on a rolling basis. First payout takes 7-10 days; subsequent payouts are typically daily or weekly based on your Stripe settings.

**Refunds**: Issue full or partial refunds directly from CoachIQ. Money returns to client's original payment method.
