## Three ways clients pay

**Direct purchase** Client books session → Selects time → Pays with card → Confirmed

**Subscription billing** Client subscribes → Card charged monthly → Receives credits/access automatically

**Access code** Client enters code → Discount applied (or free) → Access granted

## Payment processing fees

Stripe charges 2.9% + \$0.30 per successful transaction (US rates). You can configure products to either:

- Absorb the fee (you receive less)
- Pass to customer (they pay slightly more)

<Note>
  Fees are set by Stripe, not CoachIQ. International rates and currency conversions may differ.
</Note>

## What you need to know

**Stripe handles everything**: CoachIQ doesn't store card numbers or process payments directly. Stripe manages all payment security, PCI compliance, and fraud prevention.

**Automatic reconciliation**: Every transaction in CoachIQ syncs with Stripe in real-time. Your records always match.

**Bank deposits**: Stripe deposits funds to your bank account on a rolling basis. First payout takes 7-10 days; subsequent payouts are typically daily or weekly based on your Stripe settings.

**Refunds**: Issue full or partial refunds directly from CoachIQ. Money returns to client's original payment method.

## Common questions

  <Accordion title="Do I need a business bank account?">
    No. You can connect Stripe to any bank account—personal or business. However, a business account is recommended for accounting and tax purposes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I accept payments without Stripe?">
    No. Stripe is the payment processor for CoachIQ. You must have a Stripe account to accept payments through the platform.
  </Accordion>

    CoachIQ supports all currencies that Stripe supports. Set your currency in Stripe, and it applies to all CoachIQ transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do taxes work?">

    Consider consulting a tax professional for your specific situation.
