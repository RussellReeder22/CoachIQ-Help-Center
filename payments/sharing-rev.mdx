<Info>
**Where to find this**: Product Builder → Section 6 (Advanced Settings) → Revenue Sharing
</Info>

<Warning>
**Early feature - Setup required**: Revenue sharing is a basic feature that requires CoachIQ support to configure. Contact support to enable.
</Warning>

## What revenue sharing is

Route product revenue directly to another CoachIQ organization's Stripe account instead of yours.

**What it does:**
- Client purchases your product
- Payment goes to partner's Stripe account (not yours)
- You receive no money from this product
- Partner receives 100% of revenue

**What it doesn't do:**
- ❌ Split revenue between accounts
- ❌ Calculate percentages
- ❌ Send partial amounts
- ❌ Work with non-CoachIQ accounts

This is an all-or-nothing redirect, not a revenue split.

## When to use revenue sharing

**Common scenarios:**

**White-label programs:**
- You create the program
- Partner organization delivers it
- Revenue goes directly to partner

**Referral products:**
- You list partner's product
- Clients book through your page
- Partner receives all payment

**Franchise or multi-location:**
- Central organization manages products
- Individual locations receive revenue
- Each location has own CoachIQ organization

<Note>
If you need to split revenue (you get 70%, partner gets 30%), this feature doesn't support that. Revenue sharing sends 100% to the other organization.
</Note>

## Requirements

Both parties must have:

✅ Active CoachIQ organization
✅ Connected Stripe account
✅ CoachIQ support to configure connection

**You cannot:**
- Set this up yourself
- Connect to non-CoachIQ accounts
- Route to personal Stripe accounts
- Configure complex splits

## How to set up revenue sharing

<Steps>
<Step title="Contact CoachIQ support">
Email support with:
- Your organization name
- Partner's CoachIQ organization name
- Which product(s) need revenue sharing
- Confirmation from partner they approve this

<Warning>
Do NOT configure revenue sharing settings in Product Builder until support completes setup.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Support configures connection">
CoachIQ support will:
- Verify both organizations
- Connect the Stripe accounts
- Enable revenue sharing for specified products
- Confirm setup complete

This typically takes 1-2 business days.
</Step>

<Step title="Test with small transaction">
After support confirms setup:
1. Make test purchase (use low-cost product or test mode)
2. Verify payment appears in partner's Stripe account
3. Confirm payment does NOT appear in your account

<Check>
**Setup verified.** Revenue now routes to partner organization.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## What clients see

**From client perspective:**
- Nothing changes
- They book through your CoachIQ page
- Checkout looks normal
- Receipts come from your organization
- They don't know payment went elsewhere

Revenue routing is invisible to clients. They interact with you, money goes to partner.

## What you see

**In your CoachIQ:**
- Product appears in your Products list
- Transactions show in your Transactions page
- BUT money deposits to partner's Stripe account
- Your Stripe account receives $0

<Info>
Transaction records appear in your CoachIQ for tracking, but funds go to partner's bank account.
</Info>

## What partner sees

**In partner's CoachIQ:**
- Product doesn't appear in their Products list
- Transaction appears in their Transactions page
- Money deposits to their Stripe account
- Funds reach their bank account per normal Stripe schedule

## Limitations

**This feature is very basic:**

**Cannot:**
- Split revenue (only 100% redirect)
- Route to multiple accounts
- Calculate percentages
- Work with non-CoachIQ organizations
- Route different products to different partners (requires support setup per product)

**Cannot change easily:**
- Requires support to modify
- Can't toggle on/off yourself
- Can't change destination account yourself

<Warning>
Revenue sharing is permanent until you contact support to remove it. Plan carefully before implementing.
</Warning>

## Managing revenue-shared products

**To modify or remove:**

Contact CoachIQ support with:
- Product name
- Requested change (remove revenue sharing, change destination, etc.)
- Effective date for change

**Support will:**
- Update configuration
- Confirm changes
- Verify new routing works correctly

Allow 1-2 business days for modifications.

## Alternatives if this doesn't fit

**If you need more control:**

**Manual payment forwarding:**
- Receive payment in your account
- Transfer to partner manually via bank transfer
- More work but more flexibility

**Separate booking pages:**
- Partner creates their own product
- You direct clients to their page
- No revenue sharing needed

**Invoice partner:**
- Partner invoices you for services
- You pay them separately
- Keep revenue in your account

## Before you set up revenue sharing

**Confirm with partner:**
- They have active CoachIQ organization
- Their Stripe is connected
- They approve revenue routing
- Both parties understand this is 100% redirect

**Document agreement:**
- Written agreement on revenue arrangement
- Tax responsibilities clear
- Product ownership defined
- Termination process established

**Plan for taxes:**
- Partner reports all revenue (they received it)
- You report $0 for these products
- Consult accountant for proper handling

<Warning>
Revenue sharing affects tax reporting. The party receiving money must report it as income.
</Warning>
