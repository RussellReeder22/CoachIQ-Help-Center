## Canceling subscriptions

Two ways to cancel a subscription:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cancel at period end">
    **Recommended approach**

    Client keeps access through current billing period. Subscription ends on next billing date.

    **What happens:**

    1. Client retains access until period ends
    2. Credits remain valid until period ends
    3. No refund issued
    4. No future charges
    5. Subscription status changes to "Canceled" on end date

    **When to use:** Default cancellation method. Fair to client who already paid for current period.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cancel immediately">
    **Instant termination**

    Client loses access right now. Subscription ends today.

    **What happens:**

    1. Client loses access immediately
    2. Credits expire immediately
    3. Partial refund may be issued (optional)
    4. No future charges
    5. Subscription status changes to "Canceled" now

    **When to use:** Client requests immediate cancellation, fraudulent account, terms violation.

    <Warning>
      Immediate cancellation without refund may frustrate clients who prepaid. Use carefully.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Updating client payment methods

Client needs to update their card for future charges.

**Client updates from their portal**

Instruct client:

1. Log into Athlete Portal
2. Click profile picture in top right hand corner
3. Navigate to **Billing**
4. Add or update card

No action needed from you.

## Handling failed subscription payments

When subscription payment fails, status changes to Past Due.

**Automatic Stripe retries:**

- First retry: 3 days after failure
- Second retry: 5 days after first retry
- Third retry: 7 days after second retry
- Final attempt: 10 days after third retry

## Common subscription management scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client wants to downgrade from unlimited to limited sessions">
    **Current approach:**

    1. Cancel current subscription (at period end)
    2. Client purchases new subscription product after period ends
    3. New subscription starts with different pricing/credits

    **Future:** Subscription switching without gap coming soon.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client paid but wants immediate refund and cancellation">
    **Steps:**

    1. Issue full refund for current period
    2. Choose "Cancel subscription" when refunding
    3. Select "Cancel immediately"

    Client gets money back and loses access now.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client wants to pause subscription for 2 months (injury, travel)">
    **CoachIQ doesn't support pause directly.**

    **Options:**

    1. Cancel now, client resubscribes when ready (loses pricing if changed)
    2. Use Stripe Dashboard to pause subscription (requires setup)
    3. Let subscription continue, client just doesn't book sessions

    Most coaches use option 3 for short pauses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client's card expires next month">
    **Proactive approach:**

    1. Check upcoming card expirations (visible in Stripe)
    2. Send payment update link before expiration
    3. Avoid failed payment entirely

    Better than waiting for failure and dealing with Past Due status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client disputes subscription charge with bank">
    **Bank chargeback process:**

    If client disputes with bank (not you), Stripe notifies you of chargeback.

    **Your response:**

    1. Check Stripe Dashboard for chargeback details
    2. Provide evidence (subscription terms, usage logs, confirmation emails)
    3. Stripe submits evidence to bank
    4. Bank makes final decision (can take 60-90 days)

    **If you lose:** Money is returned to client + chargeback fee (\$15)

    **If you win:** You keep the payment

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preventing cancellations

**Best practices to reduce churn:**

**Before cancellation:**

- Understand why client wants to cancel
- Offer solutions (schedule flexibility, product downgrade)
- Provide pause option if temporary issue
- Remind of progress made and value received

**At risk indicators:**

- Multiple failed payments
- Declining session bookings
- No recent activity
- Support complaints

**Retention strategies:**

- Proactive check-ins with inactive subscribers
- Usage reports showing progress
- Exclusive member benefits
- Loyalty rewards or discounts

<Tip>
  Retaining existing subscribers costs less than acquiring new ones. Invest in retention.
</Tip>

## Resubscribing canceled clients

When client wants to restart canceled subscription:

**Process:**

1. Client purchases subscription product again (like new customer)
2. New subscription created with new ID
3. New billing schedule starts
4. Old subscription remains canceled in history

**You cannot:**

- Reactivate old canceled subscription
- Restore previous subscription ID
- Resume old billing schedule

<Note>
  Each subscription is independent. Cancellation is permanent. Resubscribing creates entirely new subscription.
