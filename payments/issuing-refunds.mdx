## When to issue refunds

Common refund scenarios:

**Client request:**

- Can't attend purchased session
- Dissatisfied with service
- Duplicate charge

**Business error:**
- Charged wrong amount
- Charged wrong client

## Full vs. partial refunds

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Full Refund">
**Return entire payment amount**

Client receives 100% of what they paid.

**When to use:**
- Complete cancellation before service
- Major service failure
- Accidental duplicate charge
- Client never received product/access

**Example:** $75 session → Refund $75
</Tab>

<Tab title="Partial Refund">
**Return portion of payment**

Client receives specific dollar amount, less than full charge.

**When to use:**
- Prorated cancellation mid-period
- Partial service failure
- Processing fee adjustment
- Custom settlement amount

**Example:** $200 monthly membership, cancel on day 15 → Refund $100 (half month)

<Tip>
Calculate prorated refunds: (Amount / Days in period) × Days unused

</Info>

## Refunding subscription payments

When refunding subscription charges, additional options appear:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Refund only">
**Issue refund, keep subscription active**

Money returned but subscription continues billing.

**When to use:**
- Service issue compensation
- Billing adjustment
- Goodwill gesture without cancellation

Client retains access, credits don't expire, future charges continue.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Refund + Cancel">
**Issue refund and end subscription**

Money returned AND subscription canceled.

**Options:**
- Cancel at period end (access until current period expires)
- Cancel immediately (access ends now)

**When to use:**
- Client canceling due to dissatisfaction
- Full service cancellation
- Client no longer wants service

<Tip>
Most common choice. Refunding usually means client wants to end relationship.
</Tip>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Refund limitations

**Time limits:**
- Stripe allows refunds up to 180 days after charge
- After 180 days, contact Stripe support for special handling

**Amount limits:**
- Can't refund more than original charge
- Can refund less (partial refund)
- Can issue multiple partial refunds until full amount refunded

**Already refunded:**
- Can't refund same transaction twice
- Can't reverse a refund once processed

**Failed payments:**
- Can't refund payments that failed
- No money was collected, so nothing to refund

<Warning>
Refunds are final. You cannot cancel or reverse a refund once confirmed.
</Warning>

## Refund fees

**Stripe processing fees:**

**Original charge:** You paid 2.9% + $0.30

**After refund:** 
- Transaction fee NOT refunded by Stripe
- You lose the fee even though client got money back

**Example:**
- Client pays $100
- Stripe takes $3.20 in fees
- You receive $96.80
- You refund $100 to client
- Stripe charges you $100
- Net loss: $103.20 (original $100 + $3.20 fees)

<Note>
Factor fees into refund policies. Some coaches deduct Stripe fees from refunds to avoid this loss.
</Note>

## Partial refund calculations

**Common scenarios:**

**Prorated monthly cancellation:**
- $200/month subscription
- Client cancels on day 15 of 30-day month
- Unused: 15 days
- Refund: $200 × (15/30) = $100

**Session package partial use:**
- 10-session package for $650
- Client used 3 sessions
- Remaining: 7 sessions
- Refund: $650 × (7/10) = $455

**Processing fee deduction:**
- $100 charge
- Stripe fee: $3.20
- Refund after fee: $96.80

<Tip>
Be consistent with refund calculations. Document your policy and apply it uniformly.
</Tip>

## Refund policies

**Elements of clear refund policy:**

**Time window:**
- How long after purchase can client request refund?
- Example: "30-day money-back guarantee" or "No refunds after 48 hours"

**Conditions:**
- What qualifies for refund?
- What doesn't qualify?
- Example: "Unused sessions only" or "Cancel 24 hours before session"

**Process:**
- How does client request refund?
- How long does approval take?
- Example: "Email requests processed within 2 business days"

**Exceptions:**
- Emergency situations
- Injury or illness
- Special circumstances

**Display policy:**
- On checkout page
- In terms and conditions
- In confirmation emails

<Warning>
Clearly communicate refund policy BEFORE purchase. Reduces disputes and chargebacks.
</Warning>

## Handling refund requests

**Best practices:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Listen to client">
Understand why they want refund. Sometimes issue can be resolved without refund.
</Step>

<Step title="Review your policy">
Does request qualify based on your terms?
</Step>

<Step title="Offer alternatives">
Before refunding, consider:
- Rescheduling session
- Transferring credits to friend/family
- Service credit for future use
- Discounted makeup session
</Step>

<Step title="Process refund promptly">
If refund warranted, process within 24-48 hours. Delays increase frustration.
</Step>

<Step title="Communicate clearly">
Explain what to expect:
- Refund amount
- Processing timeline (5-10 days)
- Account changes (credits removed, access ended)
</Step>

<Step title="Follow up">
After refund processes, check in to ensure client satisfied with resolution.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Refunds vs. chargebacks

**Refund (you initiate):**
- You control timing and amount
- No additional fees
- Maintains client relationship
- Professional resolution

**Chargeback (client disputes with bank):**
- Bank controls outcome
- $15 chargeback fee even if you win
- Damages relationship
- Affects Stripe account health

<Check>
Always offer to refund if client unhappy. Prevents chargebacks and maintains goodwill.
</Check>

## Tracking refunds

**Monitor refund metrics:**

**Refund rate:** (Refunds / Total transactions) × 100

**Average refund amount:** Total refunded / Number of refunds

**Refund reasons:** Track most common causes

**Refund cost:** Total revenue lost to refunds + fees

**Use data to:**
- Identify problem areas (policies, products, services)
- Improve client satisfaction
- Reduce refund requests
- Adjust policies if needed

<Tip>
Healthy refund rate: Under 5% of total transactions. Higher rates indicate issues needing attention.
