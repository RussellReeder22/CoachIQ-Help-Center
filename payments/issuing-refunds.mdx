</Note>

## Full vs. partial refunds

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full Refund">
    **Return entire payment amount**

    Client receives 100% of what they paid.

    **When to use:**

    - Complete cancellation before service
    - Major service failure
    - Accidental duplicate charge
    - Client never received product/access

    **Example:** \$75 session → Refund \$75
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Partial Refund">
    **Return portion of payment**

    Client receives specific dollar amount, less than full charge.

    **When to use:**

    - Prorated cancellation mid-period
    - Partial service failure
    - Processing fee adjustment
    - Custom settlement amount

    **Example:** 200 monthly membership, cancel on day 15 → Refund 100 (half month)

    <Tip>
      Calculate prorated refunds: (Amount / Days in period) × Days unused
    </Tip>

## Refunding subscription payments

When refunding subscription charges, additional options appear:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Refund only">
    **Issue refund, keep subscription active**

    Money returned but subscription continues billing.

    **When to use:**

    - Service issue compensation
    - Billing adjustment
    - Goodwill gesture without cancellation

    Client retains access, credits don't expire, future charges continue.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Refund + Cancel">
    **Issue refund and end subscription**

    Money returned AND subscription canceled.

    **Options:**

    - Cancel at period end (access until current period expires)
    - Cancel immediately (access ends now)

    **When to use:**

    - Client canceling due to dissatisfaction
    - Full service cancellation
    - Client no longer wants service

    <Tip>
      Most common choice. Refunding usually means client wants to end relationship.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Refund limitations

**Time limits:**

- Stripe allows refunds up to 180 days after charge
- After 180 days, contact Stripe support for special handling

**Amount limits:**

- Can't refund more than original charge
- Can refund less (partial refund)
- Can issue multiple partial refunds until full amount refunded

**Already refunded:**

- Can't refund same transaction twice
- Can't reverse a refund once processed

**Failed payments:**

- Can't refund payments that failed
- No money was collected, so nothing to refund

<Warning>
  Refunds are final. You cannot cancel or reverse a refund once confirmed.
</Warning>

## Refund fees

**Stripe processing fees:**

**Original charge:** You paid 2.9% + \$0.30

**After refund:**

- Transaction fee NOT refunded by Stripe
- You lose the fee even though client got money back

**Example:**

- Client pays \$100
- Stripe takes \$3.20 in fees
- You receive \$96.80
- You refund \$100 to client
- Stripe charges you \$100
- Net loss: 103.20 (original 100 + \$3.20 fees)

<Note>
  Factor fees into refund policies. Some coaches deduct Stripe fees from refunds to avoid this loss.
</Note>

## Partial refund calculations

**Common scenarios:**

**Prorated monthly cancellation:**

- \$200/month subscription
- Client cancels on day 15 of 30-day month
- Unused: 15 days
- Refund: $200 × (15/30) = $ 100

**Session package partial use:**

- 10-session package for \$650
- Client used 3 sessions
- Remaining: 7 sessions
- Refund: $650 × (7/10) = $ 455

**Processing fee deduction:**

- \$100 charge
- Stripe fee: \$3.20
- Refund after fee: \$96.80

<Tip>
  Be consistent with refund calculations. Document your policy and apply it uniformly.
</Tip>

## Refund policies

**Elements of clear refund policy:**

**Time window:**

- How long after purchase can client request refund?
- Example: "30-day money-back guarantee" or "No refunds after 48 hours"

**Conditions:**

- What qualifies for refund?
- What doesn't qualify?
- Example: "Unused sessions only" or "Cancel 24 hours before session"

**Process:**

- How does client request refund?
- How long does approval take?
- Example: "Email requests processed within 2 business days"

**Exceptions:**

- Emergency situations
- Injury or illness
- Special circumstances

**Display policy:**

- On checkout page
- In terms and conditions
- In confirmation emails

<Warning>
  Clearly communicate refund policy BEFORE purchase. Reduces disputes and chargebacks.
</Warning>

## Handling refund requests

**Best practices:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Listen to client">
    Understand why they want refund. Sometimes issue can be resolved without refund.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review your policy">
    Does request qualify based on your terms?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer alternatives">
    Before refunding, consider:

    - Rescheduling session
    - Transferring credits to friend/family
    - Service credit for future use
    - Discounted makeup session
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process refund promptly">
    If refund warranted, process within 24-48 hours. Delays increase frustration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communicate clearly">
    Explain what to expect:

    - Refund amount
    - Processing timeline (5-10 days)
    - Account changes (credits removed, access ended)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow up">
    After refund processes, check in to ensure client satisfied with resolution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Refunds vs. chargebacks

**Refund (you initiate):**

- You control timing and amount
- No additional fees
- Maintains client relationship
- Professional resolution

**Chargeback (client disputes with bank):**

- Bank controls outcome
- \$15 chargeback fee even if you win
- Damages relationship
- Affects Stripe account health

<Check>
  Always offer to refund if client unhappy. Prevents chargebacks and maintains goodwill.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client can't attend session they booked">
    **Your options:**

    1. Reschedule session (no refund needed)
    2. Issue credit for future use
    3. Issue full refund if within policy window

    **Recommendation:** Reschedule first, refund only if client insists or outside policy.

  <Accordion title="Client bought wrong product">
    **Process:**

    1. Issue full refund for incorrect product

    3. Or manually adjust credits if appropriate

    **Note:** Two separate transactions - refund one, new charge for correct product.
  </Accordion>

    **Process:**

    1. Verify duplicate (check transactions)
    2. Issue full refund for one charge
    3. Keep other charge active
    4. Apologize for error

    <Warning>
      Act fast on duplicate charges. Client may dispute with bank if you delay.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client wants prorated refund mid-subscription">
    **Process:**

    1. Calculate unused portion of period
    2. Issue partial refund for prorated amount
    3. Cancel subscription (at period end or immediately)

    **Example:** 300/month, cancel on day 10 of 30 = refund 200 (20 days unused)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client unhappy with service">
    **Steps:**

    1. Understand specific issue
    2. Offer to remedy (makeup session, different coach, etc.)
    3. If unresolvable, issue refund per policy
    4. Document for quality improvement

    Service refunds are judgment calls. Balance policy with customer satisfaction.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tracking refunds

**Monitor refund metrics:**

**Refund rate:** (Refunds / Total transactions) × 100

**Average refund amount:** Total refunded / Number of refunds

**Refund reasons:** Track most common causes

**Refund cost:** Total revenue lost to refunds + fees

**Use data to:**

- Identify problem areas (policies, products, services)
- Improve client satisfaction
- Reduce refund requests
- Adjust policies if needed

<Tip>
  Healthy refund rate: Under 5% of total transactions. Higher rates indicate issues needing attention.
