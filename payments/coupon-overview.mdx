## What coupons are

Coupons are discount codes that reduce product prices at checkout:

- Percentage discounts (10%, 25%, 50% off)
- Fixed amount discounts ($10, $25 off)
- Free access (100% off)

Clients enter coupon codes during checkout to apply discounts automatically.

## The Coupons page

Navigate to **Payments → Coupons** to view all discount codes.

<Frame>

</Frame>

**Page displays:**

## Three coupon types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Free">
    **100% off - No payment required**

    Product becomes free when coupon applied.

    **When to use:**

    - Promotional giveaways
    - Scholarship access
    - Sponsor/donor complimentary sessions
    - Contest prizes

    **Example:** FREESESSION code makes \$75 session free

    <Info>
      Free coupons still require checkout process to capture client info and issue credits.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Percentage Off">
    **Discount by percentage**

    Reduces price by specified percentage.

    **When to use:**

    - Promotional campaigns (25% off sale)
    - Referral rewards (20% off for referrals)
    - Seasonal discounts
    - Member benefits (10% member discount)

    **Examples:**

    - 10OFF = 10% discount
    - SPRING25 = 25% off
    - HALF = 50% discount

    <Tip>
      Percentage discounts scale with product price. $100 product with 25% off = $25 discount. $200 product with 25% off = $50 discount.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Amount Off">
    **Fixed dollar discount**

    Reduces price by specific dollar amount.

    **When to use:**

    - Fixed-value promotions (\$10 off any purchase)
    - Bundle discounts (\$50 off packages)
    - Retention offers (\$25 off return visit)

    **Examples:**

    - SAVE10 = \$10 off
    - BUNDLE50 = \$50 off
    - TWENTYFIVE = \$25 off

    <Warning>
      Amount-off coupons can't reduce price below $0. $10 off a $5 product results in $0 charge, not negative.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Coupon vs. Access Code product

**Two ways to offer special access:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Coupon">
    **Discount applied to existing product**

    - Create one coupon
    - Works with any product
    - Client selects product, then applies coupon
    - More flexible - one coupon for multiple products

    **Example:** SUMMER25 code gives 25% off any product
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access Code Product">
    **Separate product requiring code**

    - Create Access Code product type
    - Works only for that specific product
    - Client enters code to see/purchase product
    - More controlled - specific product with specific code

    **Example:** CORPORATE2025 unlocks "Corporate Partner Sessions" product

    [Learn about Access Code products →](/payments/product-types)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **General promotions:** Use coupons (one code for many products)

  **Specific partnerships:** Use Access Code products (controlled access to dedicated product)
</Tip>

## Best practices

**Code naming:**

- Make codes memorable (SPRING25, not XJ7H2K9)
- Include discount in name when possible (25OFF)
- Match campaign (REFER20 for referral program)
- Keep them short (under 15 characters)

**Discount sizing:**

- Test different amounts to find sweet spot
- Too small: Doesn't motivate action
- Too large: Erodes margins unnecessarily
- Common sweet spot: 20-30% for percentage, $25-$50 for amount

**Promotion timing:**

- Limited time creates urgency (48-hour sale)
- Seasonal alignment (SUMMER, NEWYEAR)
- Event-based (GRANDOPENING, ANNIVERSARY)

**Communication:**

- Clearly state terms (expires, limits, restrictions)
- Make codes easy to find and share
- Remind clients of expiration dates
- Celebrate redemptions (thank clients who use codes)
