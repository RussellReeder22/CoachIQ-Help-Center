    **Best for recurring revenue:**

    - Monthly unlimited training
    - Weekly session packages (e.g., 4 credits per month)

## Choosing the right type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask: How often do they pay?">
    **Once** → One-Time or Access Code

    **Recurring** → Subscription
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask: Is this publicly available?">
    **Yes, anyone can buy** → One-Time or Subscription

    **No, special access only** → Access Code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask: What are they buying?">
    **Specific session(s)** → One-Time

    **Ongoing access or credits** → Subscription

    **Discounted or free access** → Access Code
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Can you change product type later?

**No.** Product type is permanent once created.

If you need to change types:

1. Create a new product with correct type
2. Archive the old product
3. Update schedulers/programs to use new product

<Warning>
  Changing product type requires creating a new product. Existing purchases and active subscriptions continue with the old product.
</Warning>

## Multiple product types for the same offering

You can create multiple products for the same service:

**Example: Training sessions**

- One-Time: "\$75 Single Session"
- One-Time: "\$650 for 10 Sessions"
- Subscription: "\$280/month for 4 Sessions"
- Access Code: "Corporate Partner - Free"

All products attach to the same scheduler. Client chooses which payment option works best for them.

<Tip>
  Offering multiple pricing options increases conversions. Some clients prefer packages, others prefer subscriptions.
