## When to use each type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Products">
    **Best for single purchases**

    Examples:

    - Individual training sessions
    - Skills assessments or evaluations
    - One-time workshops
    - Summer camps
    - Merchandise or equipment
    - Program access (one-time fee)

    Client pays once and receives immediate access to what they purchased.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subscription Products">
    **Best for recurring revenue**

    Examples:

    - Monthly unlimited training
    - Weekly session packages (4 credits/month)
    - Facility membership
    - Program access (monthly fee)
    - Ongoing coaching packages

    Client's card charges automatically each month. They receive credits or maintain access as long as subscription is active.

      Subscriptions create predictable recurring revenue and reduce manual billing work.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access Code Products">
    **Best for special access**

    Examples:

    - Corporate partnership codes
    - Sponsor/donor free access
    - Team discount codes
    - Referral program offers
    - Promotional campaigns

    Client enters a code during checkout. Discount applies or access is granted for free.

## How products connect to your business

Products attach to three places in CoachIQ:

**Session Schedulers** → Clients book time slots and pay with products

- Schedule → Schedulers → [Select Scheduler] → Payment Settings

**Programs** → Clients purchase access to locked content

- Content → Programs → [Select Program] → Paywall Settings

**Forms** → Clients submit forms with payment

- Tools → Forms → Form Builder → Add Product

<Note>
  One product can attach to multiple schedulers, programs, or forms. Reuse products across your offerings.
</Note>

## What you need to know about products

**Stripe syncs automatically**: Products you create in CoachIQ appear in your Stripe dashboard. Products in Stripe appear in CoachIQ.

**Clients see product details**: Whatever you enter (name, description, features) displays during checkout. Write for your clients.

**Credits are optional**: Not every product needs to issue credits. Many coaches use products for payment only.

**Processing fees**: You choose whether to absorb Stripe fees (2.9% + \$0.30) or pass them to clients.

**Changes affect new purchases only**: Editing a product doesn't change existing transactions or active subscriptions.
