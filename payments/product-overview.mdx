## What products are

Products are anything you sell through CoachIQ:

- Session bookings
- Monthly memberships
- Training programs
- Access codes for partners

Each product defines what clients buy, how much they pay, and what they receive.

## When to use each type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Products">
    **Best for single purchases**

    Examples:

    - Individual training sessions
    - Skills assessments or evaluations
    - One-time workshops
    - Summer camps
    - Merchandise or equipment
    - Program access (one-time fee)

    Client pays once and receives immediate access to what they purchased.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subscription Products">
    **Best for recurring revenue**

    Examples:

    - Monthly unlimited training
    - Weekly session packages (4 credits/month)
    - Facility membership
    - Program access (monthly fee)
    - Ongoing coaching packages

    Client's card charges automatically each month. They receive credits or maintain access as long as subscription is active.

    <Check>
      Subscriptions create predictable recurring revenue and reduce manual billing work.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access Code Products">
    **Best for special access**

    Examples:

    - Corporate partnership codes
    - Sponsor/donor free access
    - Team discount codes
    - Referral program offers
    - Promotional campaigns

    Client enters a code during checkout. Discount applies or access is granted for free.

    <Info>
      Access codes can have redemption limits. Track usage to ensure codes aren't overused.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How products connect to your business

Products attach to three places in CoachIQ:

**Session Schedulers** → Clients book time slots and pay with products

- Schedule → Schedulers → [Select Scheduler] → Payment Settings

**Programs** → Clients purchase access to locked content

- Content → Programs → [Select Program] → Paywall Settings

**Forms** → Clients submit forms with payment

- Tools → Forms → Form Builder → Add Payment Field

<Note>
  One product can attach to multiple schedulers, programs, or forms. Reuse products across your offerings.
</Note>

## Product status

Products can be **Active** or **Archived**:

**Active products:**

- Appear in booking flows
- Available for purchase
- Show in product selection dropdowns
- Count toward your product limit

**Archived products:**

- Hidden from clients
- Can't be purchased
- Still show in transaction history
- Don't count toward product limit

Archive products you no longer offer but want to keep for record-keeping.

## What you need to know about products

**Stripe syncs automatically**: Products you create in CoachIQ appear in your Stripe dashboard. Products in Stripe appear in CoachIQ.

**Clients see product details**: Whatever you enter (name, description, features) displays during checkout. Write for your clients.

**Credits are optional**: Not every product needs to issue credits. Many coaches use products for payment only.

**Processing fees**: You choose whether to absorb Stripe fees (2.9% + \$0.30) or pass them to clients.

**Changes affect new purchases only**: Editing a product doesn't change existing transactions or active subscriptions.
