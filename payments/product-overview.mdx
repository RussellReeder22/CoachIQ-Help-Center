## What products are

Products are anything you sell through CoachIQ:

- Session bookings
- Monthly memberships
- Training programs
- Access codes for partners
- Digital content
- Workshops and camps

Each product defines what clients buy, how much they pay, and what they receive.

## Three product types

  <Card title="Subscription" icon="rotate">
    **Recurring billing**

    Monthly memberships, training packages

    Client pays monthly → Receives credits or access automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Code" icon="ticket">

## When to use each type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One-Time Products">
    **Best for single purchases**

    Examples:

    - Individual training sessions
    - Skills assessments or evaluations
    - One-time workshops
    - Summer camps
    - Merchandise or equipment
    - Program access (one-time fee)

    Client pays once and receives immediate access to what they purchased.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subscription Products">
    **Best for recurring revenue**

    Examples:

    - Monthly unlimited training
    - Weekly session packages (4 credits/month)
    - Facility membership
    - Program access (monthly fee)
    - Ongoing coaching packages

    Client's card charges automatically each month. They receive credits or maintain access as long as subscription is active.

    <Check>
      Subscriptions create predictable recurring revenue and reduce manual billing work.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access Code Products">
    **Best for special access**

    Examples:

    - Corporate partnership codes
    - Sponsor/donor free access
    - Team discount codes
    - Referral program offers
    - Promotional campaigns

    Client enters a code during checkout. Discount applies or access is granted for free.

    <Info>
      Access codes can have redemption limits. Track usage to ensure codes aren't overused.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How products connect to your business

Products attach to three places in CoachIQ:

**Session Schedulers** → Clients book time slots and pay with products

- Schedule → Schedulers → [Select Scheduler] → Payment Settings

**Programs** → Clients purchase access to locked content

- Content → Programs → [Select Program] → Paywall Settings

**Forms** → Clients submit forms with payment

- Tools → Forms → Form Builder → Add Product

<Note>
  One product can attach to multiple schedulers, programs, or forms. Reuse products across your offerings.
</Note>

## Product visibility: Where athletes can find products

Products don't automatically appear to athletes. You control visibility by choosing where to add them:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Athlete Portal Products Page" icon="store">
    Add products to sections in **App Builder → Products**. Athletes see them when browsing your portal (web only—not visible on iOS/Android apps).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Product Link" icon="link">
    Every product has a shareable checkout URL. Athletes can only access it if you share the link with them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attached to Scheduler" icon="calendar">
    Connect products as payment options in **Schedule → Schedulers → Payment Settings**. Athletes see them when booking sessions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attached to Form" icon="file-lines">
    Add products to forms in **Tools → Forms**. Athletes see them when submitting the form.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Check>
**Key insight**: A product you create but don't add anywhere is effectively hidden. Athletes can't discover it unless you explicitly place it in one of these locations or share its direct link.
</Check>

## Setting up products before launch

Want to create products now but launch them later? Here's the recommended workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your product">
    Build the product with all settings configured in **Payments → Products → + Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Don't add it anywhere yet">
    - Don't add to Athlete Portal Products page
    - Don't attach to any schedulers
    - Don't attach to any forms
    - Don't share the direct link
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch when ready">
    When you're ready to go live, add the product to wherever you want athletes to find it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**No "draft mode" needed**: Products are invisible to athletes until you actively place them somewhere. You can take your time configuring everything before launch.
</Tip>

## Archiving products

Archive products you no longer want to sell. Archiving completely disables a product—it can't be purchased anywhere, including via direct link.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Products page">
    Navigate to **Payments → Products**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the product">
    Click on the product row to open the action menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Archive Product">
    Click **Archive Product** to disable it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What happens when you archive:**
- Product can't be purchased anywhere (portal, schedulers, forms, direct links)
- Existing subscriptions and credits are not affected
- Transaction history and data remain intact
- Product moves to the "Archived" filter view
- You can unarchive later to re-enable the product

<Note>
**Archive vs. not adding anywhere**: If you just want to hide a product temporarily, don't add it anywhere (or remove it from where it's displayed). Use Archive when you want to completely disable a product so it can't be purchased even if someone has the direct link.
</Note>

### Viewing and restoring archived products

To see archived products, use the status filter dropdown on the Products page:
- **Active**: Products available for purchase
- **Archived**: Disabled products
- **All**: Both active and archived

To restore an archived product, view the archived product and select the option to unarchive it.

## What you need to know about products

**Stripe syncs automatically**: Products you create in CoachIQ appear in your Stripe dashboard. Products in Stripe appear in CoachIQ.

**Clients see product details**: Whatever you enter (name, description, features) displays during checkout. Write for your clients.

**Credits are optional**: Not every product needs to issue credits. Many coaches use products for payment only.

**Processing fees**: You choose whether to absorb Stripe fees (2.9% + \$0.30) or pass them to clients.

**Changes affect new purchases only**: Editing a product doesn't change existing transactions or active subscriptions.
