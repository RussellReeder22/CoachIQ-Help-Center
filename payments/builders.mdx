    - Monthly (most common)
    - Quarterly (every 3 months)
    - Semi-annually (every 6 months)

    2. Trial starts immediately
    3. First charge occurs after trial period ends
    4. Client can cancel anytime during trial (no charge)

    <Info>
      Trials increase subscription conversions by reducing commitment risk.

    - Fixed amount: Add specific dollar amount (e.g., \$2.00)
    - Percentage: Add percentage on top (e.g., 3%)

## Save vs. Publish

**Save as Draft:**

- Doesn't appear in scheduler/program/form product selection
- You can continue editing anytime
- Useful for products you're still configuring

**Publish:**

- Product immediately available for purchase
- Appears in product selection dropdowns
