<Info>
  **Where to find this**: Payments → Products → [Product] → Section 3 (Credits)
</Info>

## Access credit settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Product Builder">
    Go to **Payments → Products** and either:

    - Click **\+ Create Product** for new product
    - Click existing product name to edit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Section 3">
    Scroll to **Section 3: Credits** in the Product Builder.

    <Frame>
      ![Credits section in Product Builder](/images/payments/credits-section-location.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enable credits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Toggle credits ON">
    Find the toggle: **Add credits once purchased**

    **OFF (default):** Product doesn't issue credits. Payment-only product.

    **ON:** Product issues credits to client's account when purchased.

    <Frame>
      ![Credits toggle switch](/images/payments/credits-toggle.png)
    </Frame>
    <Tip>
      Only enable credits if you want clients to receive session bookings with this purchase. Many products don't need credits.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Additional fields appear">
    When you toggle credits ON, two more fields appear:

    - Number of credits
    - Credit expiration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set number of credits

**Field: Number of credits**

How many credits this product issues per purchase (or per billing period for subscriptions).

**Examples:**

- `1` = Single session credit
- `10` = 10-session package
- `4` = 4 sessions per month (subscriptions)
- `999` = Effectively unlimited

<Frame>
  ![Number of credits input field](/images/payments/number-of-credits-field.png)
</Frame>

<Note>
  For "unlimited" memberships, set credits to 999. This gives clients more credits than they'll realistically use.
</Note>

## Configure credit expiration

**Field: Credit expiration**

When credits become unusable and removed from client's account.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Days since purchase">
    **Credits expire X days after purchase**

    Options: 30, 60, 90, 120 days or custom

    **When to use:**

    - Session packages with time limits
    - Seasonal training programs
    - Any offer where you want expiration urgency

    **Example:** 10-session package expires 90 days after purchase

    <Frame>
      ![Days since purchase expiration options](/images/payments/expiration-days-dropdown.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specific date">
    **All credits expire on exact date**

    Calendar picker lets you select specific date.

    **When to use:**

    - Season-based programs (expire end of season)
    - Event packages (expire after event date)
    - Time-limited promotions

    **Example:** Summer camp credits expire September 1st regardless of purchase date

    <Frame>
      ![Calendar picker for specific expiration date](/images/payments/expiration-calendar-picker.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don't expire">
    **Master Credits - never expire**

    Credits remain in client's account indefinitely.

    **When to use:**

    - Premium packages with no time pressure
    - VIP client credits
    - Gift certificates
    - When you want maximum client flexibility

    **Example:** Lifetime access package with non-expiring credits

    <Warning>
      Use this carefully. Non-expiring credits can be redeemed years later when your pricing may have increased significantly.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subscription expiration">
    **Credits expire when subscription ends** (Subscription products only)

    Credits only valid while subscription is active. New credits issued each billing period.

    **When to use:**

    - Monthly memberships
    - Recurring training packages
    - Any subscription-based offering

    **Example:** Client gets 4 credits per month. Unused credits disappear at month end. New 4 credits issued with renewal.

    <Info>
      This is the default and recommended setting for subscription products.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Restrict credit usage (Section 4)

After configuring credits in Section 3, scroll to **Section 4: Usage Limits**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find usage limits section">
    **Section 4: Usage Limits** controls which schedulers accept these credits.

    <Frame>
      ![Usage Limits section in Product Builder](/images/payments/usage-limits-section.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select schedulers">
    **Field: Which schedulers accept these credits**

    **Leave blank (default):** Master Credits - work for any scheduler

    **Select specific schedulers:** Restricted credits - only work for chosen schedulers

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Master Credits">
        Don't select any schedulers OR select all schedulers.

        **Result:** Credits can book any session type you offer.

        **Best for:** General packages, flexible memberships, multi-sport training
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Restricted Credits">
        Select one or more specific schedulers.

        **Result:** Credits only work for selected session types.

        **Best for:** Specialized packages, sport-specific training, age-group restrictions

        **Example use cases:**

## Where to manage credits after purchase

Credit configuration happens in Products. Credit management happens elsewhere:

**To view client credit balances:** Schedule section → Client profile → Credits tab

**To manually adjust credits:** Schedule section → Credit management tools

**To troubleshoot credit issues:** Schedule section → Credits documentation

<Note>
  This article covers credit **configuration** in products only. For viewing, managing, and troubleshooting credits, see the Schedule section of the help center.
</Note>

## Common configuration mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credits enabled but schedulers don't accept them">
    **Problem:** Credits configured in product, but scheduler payment settings don't allow credit usage.

    **Fix:** Go to Schedule → Schedulers → [Scheduler] → Payment Settings and ensure it's set to "Credits" or "Product OR Credits", not just "Product".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Expiration too short">
    **Problem:** Clients complain credits expire before they can use them.

    **Fix:** Extend expiration period. 90 days is common for packages. Consider client scheduling patterns before setting expiration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong scheduler selected in usage limits">
    **Problem:** Client has credits but can't use them for intended sessions.

    **Fix:** Edit product → Section 4 → Add correct scheduler to usage limits list. Or remove all schedulers to make them Master Credits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subscription credits carrying over">
    **Problem:** Want credits to reset monthly, but they're accumulating.

    **Fix:** Edit product → Section 3 → Set expiration to "Subscription period" instead of "Don't expire".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
