Require clients to agree to your terms, cancellation policy, or liability waiver before they can complete a purchase. When enabled, a checkbox appears at checkout that clients must check to proceed.

<Info>
**Where to find this**: Payments → Products → Select product → Advanced section
</Info>

## How it works

When you enable terms on a product:

1. A checkbox appears on the checkout page: "I agree to the Terms and Conditions"
2. The text links to your terms page (hosted on your website or elsewhere)
3. Clients must check the box before the "Purchase Now" button works
4. The agreement is recorded with their purchase

## Enable terms on a product

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the product">
    Go to **Payments** → **Products** and select the product you want to add terms to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Advanced settings">
    Click **Advanced** in the left sidebar of the product builder.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Require Agreement to Terms">
    Toggle **Require Agreement to Terms** to ON.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your Agreement Link">
    Enter the full URL to your terms page (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/terms`).

    This is the page clients see when they click "Terms and Conditions" at checkout.

    <Tip>
    Use CoachIQ's [legal page templates](/website/pages-navigation/legal-pages) to create your terms page, then copy the URL here.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the product">
    Click **Update** (or **Create**) to save.

    <Check>
    **Done.** Clients must now accept your terms before purchasing this product.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to include in your terms

Your terms page should cover policies relevant to the product. Common sections include:

**For session packages and memberships:**
- Cancellation policy (how much notice required)
- No-show policy (whether missed sessions are forfeited)
- Refund policy
- Rescheduling rules

**For physical training:**
- Liability waiver
- Assumption of risk
- Medical clearance acknowledgment
- Emergency contact consent

**For programs with minors:**
- Parental consent
- Photo/video release
- Supervision requirements

## Creating your terms page

You have two options:

### Option 1: Use CoachIQ legal page templates (recommended)

1. Go to **Website Builder** → **Add New Page** → **Templates**
2. Select **Terms & Conditions** template
3. Customize the template with your policies
4. Publish the page
5. Copy the page URL and paste it in your product's Agreement Link

### Option 2: Use an external page

Link to any URL where your terms are hosted (Google Doc, Notion page, external website, etc.). Just make sure the link is publicly accessible.

## Terms vs. waiver forms

| Approach | Best For | How It Works |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Checkout terms** (this feature) | Quick acceptance at purchase | Checkbox + link to terms page |
| **Waiver form** | Detailed signatures, custom fields | Separate form before/after purchase |

**Use checkout terms when:**
- You need simple acknowledgment of policies
- Terms apply to the specific product being purchased
- You want acceptance tied to each transaction

**Use a [waiver form](/forms/overview) when:**
- You need detailed information (emergency contacts, medical history)
- You want a separate signed document on file
- The waiver applies to ongoing training, not just one purchase

<Tip>
Many coaches use both: checkout terms for cancellation/refund policies, plus a separate waiver form for liability and medical info.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use different terms for different products?">
    Yes. Each product has its own Agreement Link setting. You can link to different terms pages for different products (e.g., camp terms vs. membership terms).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't have a terms page yet?">
    Create one using CoachIQ's [legal page templates](/website/pages-navigation/legal-pages). You can have a basic terms page live in 15-20 minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the agreement recorded anywhere?">
    The agreement is tied to the transaction. If a client completed a purchase, they agreed to the terms that were linked at the time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can clients skip the checkbox?">
    No. When terms are enabled, the checkbox is required. Clients cannot complete the purchase without checking it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work with guest checkout?">
    Yes. The terms checkbox appears for both logged-in clients and guest checkout.
  </Accordion>
