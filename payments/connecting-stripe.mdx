</Warning>

## Connect Stripe

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Stripe settings">
    From your CoachIQ dashboard:

    1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar
    2. Select **Billing**
    3. Click **Stripe** tab

    <Frame>
      ![Navigate to Stripe settings](/images/payments/stripe-settings-navigation.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect Stripe">
    Click the blue **Connect Stripe** button.

    You'll be redirected to Stripe. If you already have a Stripe account, sign in. If not, you'll create one now.

    <Tip>
      Have multiple Stripe accounts? Make sure you're logged into the correct one before authorizing.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize CoachIQ">
    Stripe will ask you to authorize CoachIQ to access your account.

    CoachIQ needs this access to:

    - Process payments on your behalf
    - Create and manage products
    - Handle subscription billing
    - Issue refunds
    - Sync transaction data

    Click **Connect** to authorize.

    <Frame>
      ![Stripe authorization screen](/images/payments/stripe-oauth-screen.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection">
    After authorization, you'll return to CoachIQ.

    The Stripe settings page now shows:

    - **Status**: Connected (green)
    - **Account**: Your Stripe email
    - **Mode**: Test or Live

    <Check>
      **Connected.** You can now accept payments.
    </Check>
    <Frame>
      ![Stripe successfully connected](/images/payments/stripe-connected-status.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test mode vs. live mode

Stripe provides two environments:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Test Mode">
    **Use for setup and testing**

    - No real money processes
    - Use Stripe's test card numbers
    - Test booking flows, subscriptions, refunds
    - Safe environment for experimenting

    Switch to Test Mode in your Stripe dashboard to test payments without charging real cards.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Live Mode">
    **Real payments with real money**

    - Production environment
    - Charges actual credit cards
    - Money deposits to your bank
    - Switch to Live Mode when ready to accept real payments

    Your first payout takes 7-10 days. After that, payouts follow your Stripe schedule (typically daily or weekly).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  CoachIQ automatically syncs with whichever mode is active in Stripe. Toggle between modes in your Stripe dashboard.
</Info>

## Disconnect Stripe

To disconnect your Stripe account:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing → Stripe**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm disconnection

<Warning>
  Disconnecting Stripe stops all payment processing immediately. Active subscriptions won't renew until you reconnect.
</Warning>

Your transaction history and customer data remain in CoachIQ. Reconnect anytime to resume payment processing.
