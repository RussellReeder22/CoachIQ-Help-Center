## Transactions vs. Stripe Dashboard

**CoachIQ Transactions page:**

- Shows payments related to CoachIQ products
- Links to client profiles
- Integrated with your business context

**Stripe Dashboard:**

- Shows ALL Stripe charges (including non-CoachIQ)
- More detailed fee breakdowns
- Advanced filtering options
- Financial reports and analytics
- Payout information

<Info>
  Both show the same transactions but with different context. Use CoachIQ for day-to-day business, Stripe for detailed financial analysis.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting transaction issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction shows in Stripe but not CoachIQ">
    **Possible causes:**

    - Transaction not linked to CoachIQ product
    - Sync delay (wait 5 minutes and refresh)
    - Manual Stripe charge (not through CoachIQ)

    **Check:** View transaction in Stripe Dashboard to see product/metadata
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client says they paid but no transaction appears">
    **Troubleshooting:**

    1. Verify client email address (may be under different account)
    2. Check Failed transactions (payment may have declined)
    3. Check Stripe Dashboard for manual charges
    4. Verify client completed full checkout process

    Payment confirmation email proves transaction completed.
  </Accordion>
