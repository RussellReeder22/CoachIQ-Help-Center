## Transactions vs. Stripe Dashboard

**CoachIQ Transactions page:**

- Shows payments related to CoachIQ products
- Links to client profiles
- Shows credits issued
- Integrated with your business context

**Stripe Dashboard:**

- Shows ALL Stripe charges (including non-CoachIQ)
- More detailed fee breakdowns
- Advanced filtering options
- Financial reports and analytics
- Payout information

<Info>
  Both show the same transactions but with different context. Use CoachIQ for day-to-day business, Stripe for detailed financial analysis.
</Info>

## Transaction timeline

**Typical transaction lifecycle:**

**Immediate (0-5 seconds):**

- Client completes checkout
- Transaction appears in Transactions list
- Status updates to Succeeded or Failed

**Within 24 hours:**

- Transaction appears in Stripe Dashboard
- Client receives receipt email
- Credits issued (if applicable)

**Within 2-5 business days:**

- Funds become available in Stripe balance
- Money ready for payout to bank account

**Within 7-10 business days (first payout only):**

- First payout to bank account
- Subsequent payouts faster (1-2 business days)

## What you can't do on Transactions page

**Requires other tools:**

- Modify completed transactions → Use Stripe Dashboard
- Change transaction amounts → Issue refund and create new charge
- Delete transactions → Transactions are permanent records
- Merge duplicate charges → Contact Stripe support

<Warning>
  Transactions are immutable records. You can refund them, but you cannot edit or delete them.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting transaction issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction shows in Stripe but not CoachIQ">
    **Possible causes:**

    - Transaction not linked to CoachIQ product
    - Sync delay (wait 5 minutes and refresh)
    - Manual Stripe charge (not through CoachIQ)

    **Check:** View transaction in Stripe Dashboard to see product/metadata
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client says they paid but no transaction appears">
    **Troubleshooting:**

    1. Verify client email address (may be under different account)
    2. Check Failed transactions (payment may have declined)
    3. Check Stripe Dashboard for manual charges
    4. Verify client completed full checkout process

    Payment confirmation email proves transaction completed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction amount doesn't match product price">
    **Possible reasons:**

    - Processing fees added to charge
    - Coupon or discount applied
    - Partial refund issued
    - Custom pricing used

    Click transaction to see complete fee breakdown.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Need to find transaction from months ago">
    **Steps:**

    1. Use date range filter for specific time period
    2. Search by client name if known
    3. Export all transactions and search in spreadsheet
    4. Check Stripe Dashboard for more detailed history
