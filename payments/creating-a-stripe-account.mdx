## What Stripe is

Stripe is the payment processor that handles all transactions in CoachIQ. When clients pay you, Stripe:

- Securely processes credit card payments
- Manages subscription billing
- Deposits money to your bank account
- Handles payment security and fraud prevention

You need a Stripe account before you can accept payments in CoachIQ.

<Info>
  Stripe is free to sign up. You only pay fees on successful transactions (2.9% + \$0.30 per transaction in the US).
</Info>

## What you need before starting

Gather this information before creating your account:

- Business email address
- Business name (or your name if sole proprietor)
- Phone number
